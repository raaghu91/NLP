Sanskrit trishula is compound of tri त्रि "three""thorn". The Greek equivalent is τρίαινα (tríaina), from Proto-Greek trianja (threefold). The trident in the Coat of Arms of Ukraine is known as Tryzub (Тризуб), the literal translation of "trident". Uses[edit]     Mosaic, 4th century BC, showing a retiarius or "net fighter", with a trident and cast net, fighting a secutor.       Fountain of Neptune in Diafáni, Karpathos island   In Greek, Roman, and Hindu mythology, the trident is said to have the power of control over the ocean. Fishing[edit] Tridents for fishing usually have barbed tines which trap the speared fish firmly. In the Southern and Midwestern United States, gigging is used for harvesting suckers, bullfrogs, flounder, and many species of rough fish.[1] Combat[edit] The trident, known as dangpa, is featured as a weapon in the 17th- to 18th-century systems of Korean martial arts. In Ancient Rome, in a parody of fishing, tridents were famously used by a type of gladiator called a retiarius or "net fighter". The retiarius was traditionally pitted against a secutor, and cast a net to wrap his adversary and then used the trident to kill him.[2] Symbolism/mythology[edit]     Coat of Arms of Ukraine   Shiva, a Hindu God who holds a trident in his hand. In Hindu legends and stories, Shiva uses this sacred weapon to fight off negativity in the form of evil villains. The trident represents the deity in his three aspects of creator, preserver and destroyer. In Greek myth, Poseidon used his trident to create water sources in Greece and the horse. Poseidon, as well as being god of the sea, was also known as the "Earth Shaker" because when he struck the earth in anger he caused mighty earthquakes and he used his trident to stir up tidal waves, tsunamis and sea storms.Parallel to its fishing origins, the trident is associated with Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology, the Roman god Neptune. In Roman myth, Neptune also used a trident to create new bodies of water and cause earthquakes. A good example can be seen in Gian Bernini's Neptune and Triton.
