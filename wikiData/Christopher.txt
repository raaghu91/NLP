Christopher is the English version of a Europe-wide name derived from the Greek name Χριστόφορος (Christóforos). The constituent parts are Χριστός (Christós), "Christ", and φέρειν (férein), "bear": the "Christ-bearer" As a given, or first name, Christopher has been in use since the 10th century. In Denmark the name was borne by three kings (their names are usually spelled Christoffer), and included the 15th-century Christopher of Bavaria who also ruled Norway and Sweden. In English, Christopher may be abbreviated as 'Chris' or 'Kit', the latter the more common abbreviation until the later 20th century. Another less common abbreviation 'Topher' has come into wider use in the U.S. It was frequently the most popular male first name in the United Kingdom, having been in the top twenty in England and Wales from the 1940s until 1995, although it has since dropped out of the top 100. The name is most common in England and not so common in Wales, Scotland or Ireland.[1]    Contents   1 People with the name 2 Cognates in non-English languages 3 See also 4 References    People with the name[edit]  Saint Christopher (died 251), saint venerated by Catholics and Orthodox Christians Christopher (Domestic of the Schools) (fl. 870s), Byzantine general Christopher (singer) (born 1992), Danish singer Christopher Awdry (born 2 July 1940), English author best known for his contributions to The Railway Series of books featuring Thomas the Tank Engine Christopher Bengtsson (born 1993), Swedish professional ice hockey player Christopher Cerf (born August 19, 1941), American author, composer-lyricist, voice actor, and record and television producer Christopher Columbus (1451–1506), navigator, explorer, and colonizer who captained the first European ship to reach the Americas Christopher E.
