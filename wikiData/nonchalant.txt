It peaked at #44 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1996.[1] Her debut album, Until the Day, was released on March 26, 1996, and while it received positive reviews, it failed to match the success of its lead single, reaching #94 on the US Billboard 200.

She released a single entitled "Take It There" in 1998, but after it failed to catch on, she was dropped from MCA. Her last appearance was on the Half Baked soundtrack on the song entitled "Flyin'".[2]    Contents   1 Discography  1.1 Albums 1.2 Singles   2 References    Discography[edit] Albums[edit]   Year Title Chart positions   US US R&B   1996 Until the Day  Released: March 26, 1996 Label: MCA   94 20   Singles[edit]   Year Single Chart positions Album   US Hot 100 US R&B US Rap   1996 "5 O'Clock" 24 8 1 Until the Day   "Until the Day" – 88 25   References[edit]   ^ a b Roberts, David (2006).
