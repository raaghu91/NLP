His catchphrases: "Oh, no no no no no no!" and "This is the end!" In the episode "Food", he says radishes give him uncontrollable flatuence in the US but terrible tummyaches in the UK, he doesn't like beets, and that he likes sprouts as long as they have been firmly washed. Mr. Nervous often goes on wacky adventures when really he's doing something as wacky as he's imagining, most times something unrelated to the episode's subject matter (i.e. He imagines he's in a rocket ship, out of gas and about crash when it turns out he's just on a carousel). He lives in a lighthouse with a large searchlight and many locks on the door. In the US and UK Versions, he is voiced by Danny Katiana and Tim Whitnall.

Mr. Lazy runs, but his legs don't get him anywhere because he is sitting on a chair in the garden. He wakes up to realize it was all a dream, and the whistle was the kettle boiling in the kitchen. He sits down to have breakfast, and he goes to sleep yet again. In the 2008 TV series The Mr. Men Show, he is more "lazy" rather than "sleepy" as he was in the books and hates work.

Like all Mr. Men, Mr. Tickle has a simplistic look. He is orange with long arms and a small blue hat. In 2001, for the 30th anniversary of the Mr. Men, Mr. Tickle's book was released as a collector's edition hardback. It included a foreword from Adam Hargreaves. Mr. Tickle's story begins with him in bed and making himself breakfast without getting up because of his "extraordinarily long arms". He then decides that it is a tickling sort of day and so goes around town tickling people – a teacher, a policeman, a greengrocer, a station guard, a doctor, a butcher and a postman. The book ends with a warning that Mr. Tickle could be lurking around your doorway, waiting to tickle you.

In the 2008 TV series The Mr. Men Show, Mr. Tickle remains relatively the same in looks, though his hat has a stripe and his arms are normally sized, but can stretch out when needed. However, he tickles other Mr. Men and Little Misses (due to the obvious absence of humans in Dillydale). As far as character traits goes, he is still determined to tickle everyone he interacts with, but instead of doing it for mischief he does it to make people happy and will stop when nobody wants him to tickle them, save for when the opportunity knocks with Mr. Grumpy, who appears to be his favourite target. He also gets his own catchphrase, "I think somebody needs a tickle!" In the US and UK Versions, he is voiced by Jeff Stewart and Rob Rackstraw. Mr. Tickle also featured in some of the other books, such as Little Miss Magic. In her story, she reduces his arms to normal length so he can no longer be annoying and tickle anyone. She eventually gives him his arms back when he begs for forgiveness and promises to reduce his actions to one tickle a day. However, he gets his revenge as soon as he is out of the room with his long arms and uses his one tickle for the day on her.

Everybody still speaks topsy-turvy, and the reader is asked to say something topsy-turvy. Mr. Topsy-Turvy originated from a competition run by Roger Hargreaves to find a new Mr Men character and was an idea by Marc Penfold who created Mr Upside Down and a story in which the character lived in a backwards world. The idea did not win the competition but Roger Hargreaves liked the idea so much he wrote to Marc Penfold saying he would use the idea and thus Mr. Topsy-Turvy was born.
