Soldiers, sailors and airmen can be the same grade; but no two individuals can have the same rank. The terms grade and rank are often confused. The term for a title related to insignia is grade not rank. Examples of grade are Private, Sergeant, Petty Officer, Ensign, Captain, General, Admiral.  Examples of rank are first, second, etc. The term rank came from phrases such as I out-rank you, which is technically correct.  Grade also mistakenly called 'military rank' as in the U S Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and/or Civil Air Patrol.
