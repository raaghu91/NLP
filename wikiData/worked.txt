So basically any sort of energy transferred other than heat is considered work. Work can be completely converted to heat but heat cannot be completely converted to work. (e.g. a combustion engine utilizes heat to do work but is not 100% efficient)1    Mechanical work is defined when an object moves a distance X against a force f, so the force multiplied by the distance changed is work. work = force x (change in distance) Units = N·m, 1N·m = 1 Joule Electrical work is similar but its force is its charge "q" and its distance is its change in voltage. Electrical work = q x (change in voltage) In Chemistry work is the same as the physics concept by which the force is the pressure of the system and the change in distance x is the change in volume. work = pressure x (change in volume) Arts and entertainment[edit]  Work (book), a 2012 book by the anarchist collective CrimethInc Work (film), a 1915 silent film starring Charlie Chaplin Work (painting), by Ford Madox Brown Work (professional wrestling), anything staged or planned to happen in a professional wrestling presentation Work: A Story of Experience, an 1873 novel by Louisa May Alcott Work, a 1978 play by Ron Milner Work of art, an aesthetic physical item or artistic creation  Broadcast call signs[edit]  WORK-LP, an American low-power television station licensed to serve Nashua, New Hampshire WORK (FM), former name from 1974 through 2012 of WRFK (FM), an American FM radio station licensed to serve Barre, Vermont WOYK, an American AM radio station licensed to serve York, Pennsylvania known as WORK from 1932 through 1973  Music[edit]  Work (album), a 2010 album by Shout Out Louds The Work (band), a band Work Records, a music label under Sony Records Work 1989–2002, a compilation album by the electronic music duo Orbital  Songs[edit]  "Work" (Ciara song), 2009 "Work" (Iggy Azalea song), 2013 "Work" (Jars of Clay song), 2006 "Work" (Jimmy Eat World song), 2004 "Work" (Kelly Rowland song), 2007 "Work" (The Saturdays song), 2008 "Work" (The 2 Bears song), 2012 "Work Bitch", a song by Britney Spears censored as "Work" for radio releases, 2013 "Work", a song by ASAP Ferg from the mixtape Lords Never Worry "Work", a song by Bob Marley from his album Uprising "Work", a song by Gang Starr from their album Moment of Truth "Work", a song by Mac Boney from the album Grand Hustle Presents: In da Streetz Volume 4  Religion[edit]  Work (Christian theology), a person's actions or deeds, in contrast to inner qualities Karma, "work" or "deed" in Sanskrit; the principle of causality where actions influence the future in some Asian religions  People[edit]  Milton Work (1864-1934), American authority on bridge and whist  See also[edit]  "Work Work", a song by N Dubz from the album Uncle B Workington, a town in England Labour (disambiguation) The Works (disambiguation) Works (disambiguation) Working (disambiguation) All pages with titles containing "Work" All pages beginning with "Work"     This disambiguation page lists articles associated with the title Work.
