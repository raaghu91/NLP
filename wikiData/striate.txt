    Striations observed in Peloponnese, Greece.       Slickenside striations on a Pyrite-coated fault surface.   In structural geology, striations are linear furrows generated from fault movement. The striation's direction reveal the movement directions in the fault plane. Similar striations called glacial striations can occur is areas subjected to glaciation. Striations can also be a growth pattern or mineral habit shown on faces of certain minerals. Examples of minerals that can show growth striations include pyrite, feldspar, quartz, tourmaline, and sphalerite. These may also called hairline grooves.     This geology article is a stub.
