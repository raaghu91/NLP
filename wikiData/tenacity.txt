This article is about the measure of textile strength.  For the geologic term, see Tenacity (mineralogy).  For the herbicide, see Mesotrione.  For other uses, see Tenacious. Tenacity is the customary measure of strength of a fiber or yarn. In the U.S. it is usually defined as the ultimate (breaking) force of the fiber (in gram-force units) divided by the denier. Because denier is a measure of the linear density, the tenacity works out to be not a measure of force per unit area, but rather a quasi-dimensionless measure analogous to specific strength.[1] See also[edit]  Brittle fracture Specific strength Yield stress  References[edit]   ^ Rodriguez, Ferdinand (1989).
