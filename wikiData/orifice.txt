Orifice plate is a device used for measuring the volumetric flow rate in flow systems. Flow metres contain orifice plates that lie in the path of the fluid flowing and thus by conciding the edge of orifice plate with the surface of the stream, volumetric flow is measured.   Calibrated orifice is a restriction placed into a system of pipes to set the flow rate. This type of orifice is made with an opening of calculated shape and dimensions based on the required flow rate, thus controlling the flow rate.
