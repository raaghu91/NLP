(February 2014)   A derogatory term (also pejorative,[1] derogative, term of abuse, or term of disparagement) is a word or grammatical form of expression used to "detracting from the character or standing of something —often used with to, towards, or of".[2] It is also used as a criticism, hostility, disregard and/or disrespect. A term can be regarded as pejorative in some social or cultural groups but not in others. Sometimes, a term may begin as a derogatory term and eventually be adopted in a non-derogatory sense (or vice versa) in some or all contexts. When a term begins as pejorative and eventually is adopted in a non-pejorative sense this is called "melioration" in historical linguistics. It may also be called amelioration, reclaiming, or semantic change.[3] Some examples of melioration are "punk" or "dude". Name slurs can also involve an insulting or disparaging innuendo,[4] rather than being a direct derogatory remark. In some cases, a person's name can be redefined with an unpleasant or insulting meaning, or applied to a group of people considered by the majority to be inferior or lower in social class, as a group label with a disparaging meaning. Also, an ethnic slur or racial slur can be derogatory and to imply people of those groups are inferior or deficient.
