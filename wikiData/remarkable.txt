(June 2013)   Remarkable (incorporated as Remarkable Pencils Ltd) is a UK company that makes stationery products out of recycled products. Its most famous was the recycled pencil, each made from one recycled vending machine cup. The cups are collected from the Save a Cup Recycling Company. The invention became a Millennium product, which was sold as shown at the Millennium Dome. Other products have been made, including plastic rulers (also made from vending machine cups), recycled rubber tyres; to make mouse mats and pencil cases. The company was granted Â£20,000 by London Remade, and bought brand new binding machines to bind the recycled notepads. This has helped Remarkable to be able to create a greater range of products, which will help it get contracts from stores like W H Smith.         v t e   Waste and waste management       Major types    Agricultural wastewater Biodegradable waste Brown waste Chemical waste Construction waste Demolition waste Electronic waste  by country   Food waste Green waste Hazardous waste Heat waste Industrial waste Litter Marine debris Medical waste Mining waste Municipal solid waste Photodegradation Post-consumer waste Radioactive waste Sewage Toxic waste Wastewater            Processes    Anaerobic digestion Biodegradation Composting Illegal dumping Incineration Landfill Landfill mining Mechanical biological treatment Mechanical sorting Open dump Recycling Resource recovery Sewage treatment Waste collection Waste picking Waste sorting Waste treatment Waste-to-energy         Countries    Armenia Bangladesh Brazil Hong Kong India New Zealand Russia Switzerland UK USA         Agreements    Bamako Convention Basel Convention EU directives  batteries landfills RoHS framework incineration waste water WEEE   London Convention Oslo Convention OSPAR Convention         Other topics    Cleaner production Downcycling Eco-industrial park Extended producer responsibility High-level radioactive waste management History of waste management Sewage regulation and administration Upcycling Waste hierarchy Waste legislation Waste minimisation Zero waste             Environment portal  Category  Commons Concepts Index Journals Lists Organizations         External links[edit]  Remarkable's Website
