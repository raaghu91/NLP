"Cacophony" and "Euphony" redirect here. For other uses, see Cacophony (disambiguation) and Euphony (disambiguation). Phonaesthetics (from the Greek: φωνή phōnē, "voice-sound"; and αἰσθητική aisthētikē, "aesthetics") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences. The closely related but different concept of phonaesthesia should be distinguished from this meaning. Phonaesthesia does not refer directly to aesthetic attributes of sound, but to phonetic elements that are inherently associated with a semantic meaning.

Some day Love shall claim his own Some day Right ascend his throne, Some day hidden Truth be known; Some day—some sweet day. — Lewis J. Bates, the poem Some Sweet Day  Observe the symmetry of the lines and how the last syllable in the first three lines rhyme. Poetry is considered euphonic, as is well-crafted literary prose[example needed]. Important phonaesthetic devices of poetry are rhyme, assonance and alliteration. Closely related to euphony and cacophony is the concept of consonance and dissonance.[how?] Cacophony[edit] Cacophony consists of harsh sounds. If a writer reads a book aloud with the sounds "Critch" "Cratch" mimicking someone walking in stilettos, it is an example of cacophony. Sub-phonematic euphony[edit]    This section may be confusing or unclear to readers. (October 2011)   In most languages, phonetic combinations which are difficult to pronounce will be adapted to allow more flowing speech, for reasons of ease of pronunciation rather than aesthetics. These adaptations will be sub-phonematic at first, but over several generations will lead to phonematically relevant sound changes. Most of the euphony or mellifluous design of a formal language is pure coincidence, yet phonaesthetics relations with meaning can arise to frequent use and may even become cliché.
