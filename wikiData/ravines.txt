Homole Ravine, Pieniny, Poland       Inside a ravine in Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, Montana, United States.   A ravine is a landform narrower than a canyon and is often the product of streamcutting erosion.[1] Ravines are typically classified as larger in scale than gullies, although smaller than valleys.[1]    Contents   1 Overview 2 Other terms 3 Notes 4 External links    Overview[edit] A ravine is generally a fluvial slope landform of relatively steep (cross-sectional) sides, on the order of twenty to seventy percent in gradient. Ravines may or may not have active streams flowing along the downslope channel which originally formed them; moreover, often they are characterized by intermittent streams, since their geographic scale may not be sufficiently large to support a perennial watercourse.[2] The difference between a canyon, gorge and ravine could be understood as follows:  a canyon is a narrow chasm with steep cliff walls formed by running water; a gorge is a deep, narrow passage with steep rocky sides formed by running water; a ravine is a deep, narrow steep-sided valley formed by running water [3]  Other terms[edit] Other terms for ravine include  cleuch dell gill or ghyll glen kloof (South Africa) chine (Isle of Wight)  Notes[edit]   ^ a b Definition of "ravine" at Merriam-Webster ^ Christopher G.
