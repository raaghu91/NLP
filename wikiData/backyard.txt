(March 2013)       Back yard of a house in Harvey, Louisiana, USA   A back yard (or backyard) is a yard at the back of a house, common in suburban developments in the Western world.[1]    Contents   1 Origin 2 Contents  2.1 Australia   3 References 4 See also 5 External links    Origin[edit] In cold-weather regions, it is economical in low land value regions to use open land surrounding a house for vegetable gardening during summers and allowing strongly demanded sunlight to enter house windows from a low horizon angle during winters. As land value increases, houses are built nearer to each other. In order to preserve some of the open land, house owners may choose to allow construction on the side land of their houses, but not build in front of or behind their house in order to preserve some remnants of open surrounding land. The back area is known as the back yard. The front area is known as the front yard. Contents[edit]     A playground being built for a homeowner's back yard as part of a handyman project.

More recently, these have been replaced by outdoor entertainments such as a barbecue and swimming pool.[3] But, since the 1990s, the trend in Australian suburban development has been for back yards to disappear as the dwellings now occupy almost all of the building plot.[1] References[edit]   ^ a b Tony Hall (2010).
