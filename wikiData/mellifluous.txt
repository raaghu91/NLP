(file)    (US) IPA(key): /məˈlɪfluəs/  Adjective[edit] mellifluous (comparative more mellifluous, superlative most mellifluous)  Flowing like honey. Sweet, smooth and musical; pleasant to hear (generally used of a person's voice, tone or writing style).  1915, W.S. Maugham, "Of Human Bondage":  "You should read Spanish," he said. "It is a noble tongue. It has not the mellifluousness of Italian, Italian is the language of tenors and organ-grinders, but it has grandeur: it does not ripple like a brook in a garden, but it surges tumultuous like a mighty river in flood."      Usage notes[edit] Mellifluous (like honey) is more likely to be applied to a person’s writing style while dulcet (“sweet”) would only be appropriate for describing audible tone, voice or tenor.
