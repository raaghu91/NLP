Meals occur primarily at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks.[3]    Contents   1 Common meals  1.1 Mealtimes   2 Other types of meals 3 See also  3.1 Types of meals 3.2 Meal structure in cuisines 3.3 Related terms and concepts   4 References 5 Further reading 6 External links    Common meals[edit] Mealtimes[edit] The type of meal served or eaten at any given time varies by custom and location. In most modern cultures, three main meals are eaten: in the morning, early afternoon, and evening. Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. Some serve dinner as the main meal at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper. Except for "breakfast", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.  Breakfast is eaten within an hour or two after a person wakes in the morning.[4] Lunch is eaten around mid-day, usually between 11 am and 2 pm. In some areas, the name for this meal depends on its content.[5] Supper or dinner or tea is eaten in the evening. In some areas, the name for this meal depends on its content, but many English-speakers use "supper" for this meal regardless of size.[6]  Other types of meals[edit]     A Swedish smörgåsbord buffet       A dabbawala in Mumbai with meals packed in tiffin carriers    A barbecue is a meal at which food (often meat or fish) is cooked out of doors on an open fire or portable grill.[7] A banquet is a large, formal, elaborate meal, with many guests and dishes.[8] A blue-plate special is a term used in the United States by restaurants that refers to a specially low-priced meal, usually changing daily. Brunch is a late-morning meal, usually larger than a breakfast and usually replacing both breakfast and lunch; it is most common on Sundays. Brunch originated in England in the late 1800s, and in the 1930s became popular in the United States.[9] A buffet typically involves diners serving themselves from foods placed in a public area. Buffets are effective for serving large numbers of people at once, and are often seen in institutional settings, such as business conventions or large parties. Some restaurants also offer buffets, such as a lunch buffet, or are specifically buffet restaurants. Elevenses, also called "morning tea", is a light snack[10] and drink taken in the late morning after breakfast and before lunch. A last meal is a meal served to a prisoner before his execution.[11] A multicourse meal is a meal of multiple dishes served in sequence.     A full course dinner in its simplest form, can consist of three or four courses, such as soup, salad, meat and dessert. In formal dining, a full course dinner can consist of many courses, and in some instances the courses are carefully planned to complement each other gastronomically. A main course is the featured or primary dish in a meal consisting of several courses. It usually follows the entrée ("entry") course. In the United States it may in fact be called "entree".     Meals on Wheels are meals delivered as a service to the homes of people who are unable to prepare their own.[12] A Meal train Meal trains are commonly organized after significant life events, including birth, adoption, surgery, illness, death, divorce, new job, or moving to a new community. Caring friends, family, co-workers, congregation members, neighbors, and communities show their excitement or compassion though the organized delivery meals. A picnic is an outdoor meal where one brings one's food, such as a sandwich or a prepared meal (sometimes in a picnic basket). It often takes place in a natural or recreational area, such as a park, forest, beach, or lawn. On long drives a picnic may take place at a roadside stop such as a rest area. Picnics are often consumed on a picnic table. A potluck is a gathering of people where each person or group of people may contribute a dish of food prepared by the person or the group of people, to be shared among the group. Second breakfast is a traditional mid-morning meal served in parts of central Europe, i.e.: Austria, Bavaria (Germany) and Poland. Tea can refer to any of several different meals or mealtimes, depending on a country's customs and its history of drinking tea. However, in those countries where the term's use is common, the influences are generally those of the former British Empire (now the Commonwealth of Nations). Tea as a meal can be small or large.     Afternoon tea is a mid-afternoon meal, typically taken at 4 pm, consisting of light fare such as small sandwiches, individual cakes and scones with tea.[13]        Ceramic meal in a Ming Dynasty burial figurine table      High tea is a British meal usually eaten in the early evening.[13]     Tiffin is a second breakfast or light lunch,[14] most commonly in India.
