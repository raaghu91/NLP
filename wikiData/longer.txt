The song can be found on Fogelberg's 1979 album Phoenix. It was also included on his 1982 greatest hits album as well as various other retrospective and compilation recordings. Fogelberg, who had released more rock-oriented songs throughout the 1970s, jokingly described "Longer" in the liner notes to one of his retrospective albums as "the song that put me on the elevators."[1] He wrote the song while vacationing in Maui, "lounging in a hammock one night and looking up at the stars. It just seems this song was drifting around the universe, saw me, and decided I'd give it a good home."[1] Accompanying Fogelberg's vocals is an acoustic guitar (played by the singer) as well as a flugelhorn solo by Jerry Hey. Lyrically, the song compares various events ("Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens") with his emotional attachment to the one he loves ("I've been in love with you").

It became Fogelberg's highest-charting hit of his career, spending two weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1980.[2] It was kept from the summit the first week by "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" by Queen, and remained in the runner-up spot the next week behind "Another Brick in the Wall" by Pink Floyd. In addition, "Longer" became the first of the singer's four No. 1 songs on the Billboard adult contemporary chart between 1980 and 1984.[1] The song reached No. 85 on the Billboard country music chart.[1] In the United Kingdom, "Longer" was Fogelberg's only song to reach the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 59.[3] Chart performance[edit]   Chart (1980) Peak position   Canadian RPM Top Singles 19   Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary 6   Canadian RPM Country Tracks 64   UK Singles Chart 59   U.S. Billboard Hot 100 2   U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary 1   U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks 85   U.S. Cashbox Magazine 1   See also[edit]  List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1980 (U.S.)  References[edit]   ^ a b c d Hyatt, Wesley (1999).
