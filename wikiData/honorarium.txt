An honorarium is an ex gratia payment (i.e., a payment made without the giver recognizing themselves as having any liability or legal obligation) made to a person for their services in a volunteer capacity or for services for which fees are not traditionally required. This is used by groups such as schools or sporting clubs to pay coaches for their costs.[1][2] Another example includes the payment to guest speakers at a conference to cover their travel, accommodation, or preparation time.

The concept of an honorarium has a tax implication. In Australia recipients of these funds make a tax declaration (known as the hobbyist form)[4] to the tax office and therefore do not have to include this money in their annual tax return. Canada[edit] In Canada, honoraria are considered salary and thus, taxable income under the Income Tax Act.[5][6] In the case where a gift is substituted for honorarium (gift in lieu of money), it is still classified as a taxable benefit by Canada Revenue Agency.[5] In cases where an honorarium is paid to an individual who is not a resident of Canada, the honorarium is still subjected to income tax withholding (usually 15%) unless prior approval was obtained from Revenue Canada.[7] Hong Kong[edit] Honoraria are subjected to taxation under HK Laws. Chap 112 Inland Revenue Ordinance and also subjected to the Mandatory Provident Fund, a compulsory saving scheme for retirement.[8][9] Indonesia[edit] Under Indonesian National Laws, honorarium recipients are subjected to withholding tax under Income Tax Article 21.[10][11] New Zealand[edit] When honorarium is paid to an employee, such as mayors, chairpersons and local clubs and societies, it is not subject to withholding tax but is subject to income tax.[12] However, if the payment was not made to the above-mentioned category of people, it is subject to withholding tax rate between 33c to 48c.[13] United Kingdom[edit] Honoraria to employees are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions under PAYE.[14][15] However payments are made based on services required and not bound by any contractual arrangements. United States[edit] An honorarium paid to a U.S. resident for services performed within or outside the U.S. is subject to federal (and in some cases state) income tax.[16] See also[edit]  Gift Tip (gratuity)  Notes[edit]   ^ http://ethics.wa.gov/opinions/99_03.htm An example of the rules for payment of an honorarium in the United States. ^ http://www.athrec.mcmaster.ca/clubs/forms/2006-2007/Athletic%20Sport%20Clubs%20Manual%20-%202007.pdf A Canadian example of the use of an honorarium. ^ http://www.bgs.qld.edu.au/news/2007Newsletters/2007_news10.pdf An example of an Australian school paying a coaching honorarium. ^ http://www.ato.gov.au/print.asp?doc=/Content/8729.htm Australian tax law regarding the payment of honoraria. ^ a b How to Pay an Honorarium ^ Individual Honoraria (bad link!) ^ THE HOOKER DISTINGUISHED VISITING PROFESSOR TRUST FUND ^ Report No. 43 of the Director of Audit ^ Mandatory Provident Fund ^ ARTICLE 21 INCOME TAX ^ Taxation of Expatriate Employee ^ When to tax honoraria ^ Activities subject to withholding tax ^ HM Revenue and Customs.
