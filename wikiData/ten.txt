Ten is the base of the decimal numeral system, by far the most common system of denoting numbers in both spoken and written language. The reason for the choice of ten is assumed to be that humans have ten fingers (digits).

The ordinal adjective is decimal; the distributive adjective is denary. Increasing a quantity by one order of magnitude is most widely understood to mean multiplying the quantity by ten. To reduce something by one tenth is to decimate. (In ancient Rome, the killing of one in ten soldiers in a cohort was the punishment for cowardice or mutiny; or, one-tenth of the able-bodied men in a village as a form of retribution, thus causing a labor shortage and threat of starvation in agrarian societies.)  In mathematics[edit] Ten is a composite number, its proper divisors being 1, 2 and 5. Ten is the smallest noncototient, a number that cannot be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total number of coprimes below it. Ten is the second discrete semiprime (2.5) and the second member of the (2.q) discrete semiprime family. Ten has an aliquot sum σ(n) of 8 and is accordingly the first discrete semiprime to be in deficit. All subsequent discrete semiprimes are in deficit. The aliquot sequence for 10 comprises five members (10,8,7,1,0) with this number being the second composite member of the 7-aliquot tree. Ten is the smallest semiprime that is the sum of all the distinct prime numbers from its lower factor through its higher factor (10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 . 5) Only three other small semiprimes (39, 155, and 371) share this attribute. It is the aliquot sum of only one number the discrete semiprime 14. Ten is a semi-meandric number. Ten is the sum of the first three prime numbers, of the four first numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4), of the square of the two first odd numbers and also of the first four factorials (0! + 1! + 2! + 3!). Ten is the eighth Perrin number, preceded in the sequence by 5, 5, 7. A polygon with ten sides is a decagon, and 10 is a decagonal number. Because 10 is the product of a power of 2 (namely 21) with nothing but distinct Fermat primes (specifically 5), a regular decagon is a constructible polygon. Ten is also a triangular number and a centered triangular number. Ten is the number of n-Queens Problem solutions for n = 5. Ten is the smallest number whose status as a possible friendly number is unknown. In numeral systems[edit] Decimal system[edit] Main article: Decimal As is the case for any base in its system, ten is the first two-digit number in decimal and thus the lowest number where the position of a numeral affects its value. Any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g. 855 * 10 = 8550). Roman numerals[edit] The Roman numeral for ten is X (which looks like two V's [the Roman numeral for 5] put together); it is thought that the V for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed). Incidentally, the Chinese word numeral for ten, is also a cross: 十. Positional numeral systems other than decimal[edit] The digit '1' followed by '0' is how the value of p is written in base p. (E.g. 16 in hexadecimal is 10.)

The number of hydrogen atoms in butane, a hydrocarbon. The number of spacetime dimensions in some superstring theories.

In religion and philosophy[edit]     The tetractys    References in the Bible, Judaism and Christianity:  The Ten Commandments of Exodus[1] and Deuteronomy[2] are considered a cornerstone of Judaism and Christianity. People traditionally tithed one-tenth of their produce. The practice of tithing is still common in Christian churches today, though it is disputed in some circles as to whether or not it is required of Christians. In Deuteronomy 26:12, the Torah commands Jews to give one-tenth of their produce to the poor (Maaser Ani). From this verse and from an earlier verse (Deut. 14:22) there derives a practice for Jews to give one-tenth of all earnings to the poor.[3] Ten Plagues were inflicted on Egypt in Exodus 7-12 Jews observe the annual Ten Days of Repentance beginning on Rosh Hashanah and ending on Yom Kippur. In Jewish liturgy, Ten Martyrs are singled out as a group. There are said to be Ten Lost Tribes of Israel (those other than Judah and Benjamin) There are Ten Sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life In Judaism, ten men are the required quorum, called a minyan, for prayer services. Interpretations of Genesis in Talmudic and Midrashic teachings suggest that on the first day, God drew forth ten primal elements from the abyss in order to construct all of Creation: Heaven (or Fire), Earth, Chaos, Void, Light, Darkness, Wind, Water, Day, and Night. See also Bereshit (parsha)     In Pythagoreanism, the number 10 played an important role and was symbolized by the tetractys. In Hinduism, Lord Maha Vishnu appeared on the earth in 10 incarnations.  In money[edit] Most countries issue coins and bills with a denomination of 10 (See e.g. 10 dollar note). Of these, the dime, with the value of ten cents, or one tenth of a dollar, derives its name from the meaning "one-tenth" - see Dime (United States coin)#Denomination history and etymology. In music[edit]  The interval of a major tenth is an octave plus a major third. The interval of a minor tenth is an octave plus a minor third. The title of quite a few albums. See Ten (album).

Also, the number 10 plays a role in the following:  In American football, the end zones are 10 yards deep. In association football, the number 10 is traditionally worn by the team's playmaker. This use has led to "Number 10" becoming a synonym for that particular player, even if he or she does not wear that number. In Australian rules football, considered the break even amount of games won in a regular 22 game season. In baseball, 10 is the minimum number of players on the field at any given time during play (including the batter). In basketball:  The top of the rim (goal) is 10 feet from the floor. In standard full-court basketball, there are 10 players on the court (5 on each team).   In blackjack, the Ten, Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10 points. In boxing, if the referees counts to 10 whether the boxer is unconscious or not, it will declare a winner by knockout. In cricket, 10 is the number of wickets required to be taken by the bowling side for the batting side to be bowled out. In gridiron football, 10 is the number of yards the offense must advance to maintain possession in a single set of downs—four in American and three in Canadian. In most rugby league competitions, the number 10 is worn by one of the two starting props. (One exception to this rule is the European Super League, which uses static squad numbering.) In rugby union, the starting fly-half wears the 10 shirt. In ten-pin bowling, 10 pins are arranged in a triangular pattern and there are 10 frames per game. The highest score possible in Olympics gymnastics competitions. Driving a racing car at ten-tenths is driving as fast as possible, on the limit.
