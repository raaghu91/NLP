Created and written by Howard Overman, the first series stars Lucy Punch as D.I. Kate Bishop and Toby Stephens as D.I. Jack Armstrong, a detective duo with a fractious relationship. Jack is lazy and disorganised but charming whereas Kate is efficient and usually exasperated by Jack's way of doing things. The show also starred Rory Kinnear who plays Kate's husband Dan, with whom she is going through marriage counselling. Other recurring characters are Naz, an eccentric crime scene specialist, and Tony, owner of the bar at which the characters relax. The drama is set in contemporary London. In the second series (first announced on 18 January 2012) Lucy Punch and Rory Kinnear did not return. Lucy's character was replaced by Miranda Raison playing D.I. Georgina Dixon, with Nick Dunning playing her father, a retired policeman with a dubious security business.[2][3]    Contents   1 Cast 2 Production 3 Critical reception 4 Episode list  4.1 Series One 4.2 Series Two   5 DVD releases 6 References 7 External links    Cast[edit]  Toby Stephens as D.I.

Critical reception[edit] The series received an arguably mixed response from critics. The Liverpool Echo‍ '​s Paddy Shennan called it "deliciously black" and added that it could become a "cop classic". He also praised Stephens's performance, likening it to Leslie Nielsen's in The Naked Gun.[6] The Guardian‍ '​s Sam Wollaston also liked it, saying "It's cheeky, irreverent, puerile, sometimes inappropriate It also made me laugh, almost out loud a few times, and that's no bad thing in a comedy" and again praised Stephens's acting, saying he was "fabulous", while Punch's performance was "excellent".[7] Most others disagreed. the Metro called it "rubbish" and said Stephens's acting was "over the top"[8] The Daily Telegraph‍ '​s Patrick Smith lamented its "Thuddingly lame humour",[9] Paul Connolly in the Daily Mail added that the programme didn't seem to know what it wanted to be but "What it most certainly wasn't, was funny".[10] Rachel Cooke of the New Statesman called it "atrocious".[11] "Truly abysmal" said Kevin Myers of the Irish Independent [12] Sean Myers blamed "a sub-standard script totally lacking in style and imagination".[13] and Damien Love of The Herald (Glasgow) said it was "Bad beyond belief... one of the worst things I have ever seen on television.",[14] and likened Toby Stephen's performance to "Hugh Grant doing an impression of Ross Kemp, doing an impression of Hugh Grant doing an impression of Bodie from The Professionals", although he believed there was a chance that Lucy Punch was "wasted" in the show.
