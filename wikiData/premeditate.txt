In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of homicide, and is punished more severely than manslaughter or other types of murder - often with the death penalty or a life sentence without the possibility of parole. In the U.S, Federal law criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder at Title 18 United States Code Section 1111 The Criminal Code of Canada classifies murder as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder. See also[edit]  Malice aforethought  References[edit]   ^ Premeditation [1]      This crime-related article is a stub.
