For the Austrian municipality, see Droß.     Aluminium dross   Dross is a mass of solid impurities floating on a molten metal or dispersed in the metal, such as in wrought iron. It forms on the surface of low-melting-point metals such as tin, lead, zinc or aluminium or alloys by oxidation of the metal(s). With wrought iron, hammering and later rolling removed some dross.[1] With tin and lead the dross can be removed by adding sodium hydroxide pellets, which dissolve the oxides and form a slag. Dross can also be skimmed off. Dross, as a solid, is distinguished from slag, which is a liquid. Dross product is not entirely waste material; aluminium dross, for example, can be recycled and is used in secondary steelmaking for slag deoxidation.[2]    Contents   1 Etymology and usage 2 See also 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links    Etymology and usage[edit] The term dross derives from the Old English word dros, meaning the scum produced when smelting metals. By the 15th century it had come to refer to rubbish in general.[3] Dregs,[3] and the geological term druse are also thought to be etymologically related.[4] Metallurgical dross is referenced as a metaphor for worthless material in the Bible and in other religious texts.[note 1] [note 2] See also[edit]  Aluminium alloy inclusions Slag  Notes[edit]   ^ In the Book of Ezekiel 22 v 18 : "Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.",[5] in the Book of Proverbs,[6] and in the Book of Mormon (Alma 32:3 ) "Therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross.".[7] ^ In the Buddhist text, the Dhammapada: 239. One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a wise man should remove his own impurities, as a smith removes his dross from silver.[8]   References[edit]   ^ Landes, David S. (1969).
