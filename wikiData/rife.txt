It is an official bootleg, initially released by J. G. Thirlwell with no record label credit. This album was released in three formats: a two-LP set on black vinyl, a two-LP picture disc set, and a CD. Rife is Self Immolation #RIFLE 1 and #RIFLEPIC 1 for the picture disc. After its initial release, Jungle Records was authorized in 1988 to produce a limited edition official release of 2,000 albums split between the three formats. Jungle itself self-bootlegged Rife in 1996, producing 500 additional, unauthorized picture disc albums. In 1998, Jungle licensed Rife to Invisible Records, which began producing additional (and possibly unauthorized) CDs.
