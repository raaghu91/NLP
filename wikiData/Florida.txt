Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous,[5] and the 8th most densely populated of the 50 United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. Much of Florida is a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida. Its geography is notable for a coastline, omnipresent water and the threat of hurricanes. Florida has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, encompassing approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south.[9] Some of its most iconic animals, such as the American alligator, crocodile, Florida panther and the manatee, can be found in the Everglades National Park. Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León – who named it La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] "The Flowery") upon landing there during the Easter season, Pascua Florida[10] – Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Indians, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. Today, Florida is distinguished by its large Hispanic community and high population growth, as well as its increasing environmental concerns. Its economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also known for its amusement parks, the production of oranges and the Kennedy Space Center. Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing and water sports.

European arrival Main article: Spanish Florida     St. Augustine is the oldest city in the U.S., established in 1565 by Spain.   Florida was the first part of the continental United States to be visited by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León. De León spotted the peninsula on April 2, 1513, and he named the region La Florida ("flowery land").[11] The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language and more to Florida.[12][broken citation] Both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano established a colony at present-day Pensacola, one of the first European settlements in the continental United States, but it was abandoned by 1561. In 1565, the Spanish colony of St. Augustine (San Agustín) was established. Spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes to Christianity. The area of Spanish Florida diminished with the establishment of English colonies to the north and French colonies to the west. The English attacked St. Augustine, burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times. Florida attracted numerous Africans and African Americans from adjacent British colonies in North America who sought freedom from slavery. The Spanish Crown gave them freedom, and those freedmen settled north of St. Augustine in Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first free black settlement of its kind in what became the United States.[citation needed]     The five flags of Florida from the right, Spain (1565–1763), the Kingdom of Great Britain, Spain (1784–1821), the Confederacy, and the United States. France (flag not shown) also controlled part of Florida.   Great Britain controlled Florida from 1763 to 1783. Great Britain gained control of Florida through the Peace of Paris and exchanges of possessions with Spain. The British divided their new acquisitions into East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine, and West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola, by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. East Florida and West Florida did not send any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence.[13] Spain received both Floridas after Britain's defeat by the American colonies and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles in 1783, continuing the division into East and West Florida. Joining the United States; Indian Removal See also: Florida Territory and Seminole Wars Spain offered land grants to anyone who settled in the Florida colonies, and many Americans moved to them. After settler attacks on Indian towns, Seminole Indians based in East Florida began raiding Georgia settlements, purportedly at the behest of the Spanish. The United States Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War. Following the war, the United States effectively controlled East Florida. Upon full ratification in 1821, the Adams-Onís Treaty ceded East Florida and West Florida to the United States in exchange for $5 million and the American renunciation of any claims on Texas. President James Madison was authorized on March 3, 1821 to take possession of East Florida and West Florida for the United States and provide for initial governance.[14] Andrew Jackson served as military governor of the newly acquired territory, but only for a brief period. On March 30, 1822, the United States merged East Florida and part of West Florida into the Florida Territory.[15]     Attack on New River settlement in a contemporary rendition   By the early 1800s, Indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern U.S. and also in Florida. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the United States government to remove the Indians from Florida. Seminoles harbored runaway blacks, known as the Black Seminoles, and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, the Treaty of Payne's Landing promised to the Seminoles lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida. Many Seminole left at this time. Some Seminoles remained, and the U.S. Army arrived in Florida, leading to the Second Seminole War (1835–42). Following the war, approximately 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to Indian Territory. A few hundred Seminole remained in Florida in the Everglades.     A Cracker cowboy, 19th century   On March 3, 1845, Florida became the 27th state of the United States of America.[16] The state was admitted as a slave state, although initially its population grew slowly. White settlers continued to encroach on Seminole lands, and the United States intervened to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The Third Seminole War (1855–58) resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining Seminoles, although hundreds of Seminole Indians remained in the Everglades.[17] Slavery, Civil War, and Disenfranchisement Further information: Florida in the American Civil War     The Battle of Olustee during the American Civil War in 1864.   White settlers began to establish cotton plantations in Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market. By 1860 Florida had only 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved. There were fewer than 1,000 free African Americans before the Civil War.[18] In January 1861, Florida declared its secession from the Union and became a founding member of the Confederate States. The Confederates received little help from Florida; the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere. The largest engagements in the state were the battle of Olustee on February 20, 1864 and the battle of Natural Bridge, just south of Tallahassee, on March 6, 1865. Both were Confederate victories.[19] The war ended in 1865. Following the Civil War, Florida's congressional representation was restored on June 25, 1868. After Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature. In 1885 they created a new constitution, followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Until the mid-20th century, Florida was the least populous Southern state. In 1900 its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War.[20] The boll weevil devastated cotton crops. Forty thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population, left the state in the Great Migration. They left due to lynchings and racial violence, and for better opportunities.[21] Disfranchisement for most African Americans in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage. 20th century growth Historically, Florida's economy was based upon agricultural products such as cattle farming, sugarcane, citrus, tomatoes, and strawberries. Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the Florida land boom of the 1920s, which brought a brief period of intense land development. Devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928, followed by the Great Depression, brought that period to a halt. Florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for World War II. The climate, tempered by the growing availability of air conditioning, and low cost of living made the state a haven. Migration from the Rust Belt and the Northeast sharply increased Florida's population after the war. In recent decades, more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy. With a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census, Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern United States, and the fourth most populous in the United States.

Main article: Geography of Florida See also: List of counties in Florida and List of Florida state parks Much of the state of Florida is situated on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits of Florida. Spanning two time zones, it extends to the northwest into a panhandle, extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is bordered on the north by the states of Georgia and Alabama, and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is near several Caribbean countries, particularly The Bahamas and Cuba. Florida is one of the largest states east of the Mississippi River, and only Alaska and Michigan are larger in water area. The water boundary is 3 nautical miles (3.5 mi; 5.6 km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean[22] and 9 nautical miles (10 mi; 17 km) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.[22]     The summit of Britton Hill, Florida's highest point at 345 feet, is located in northern Walton County.   At 345 feet (105 m) above mean sea level, Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any U.S. state.[23] Much of the state south of Orlando lies at a lower elevation than northern Florida, and is fairly level. Much of the state is at or near sea level. However some places such as Clearwater have promontories that rise 50 to 100 ft (15 to 30 m) above the water. Much of Central and North Florida, typically 25 mi (40 km) or more away from the coastline, have rolling hills with elevations ranging from 100 to 250 ft (30 to 76 m). The highest point in peninsular Florida (east and south of the Suwanee River), Sugarloaf Mountain, is a 312-foot (95 m) peak in Lake County.[24] Climate Main articles: Climate of Florida and Geography of Florida § Climate See also: List of Florida hurricanes and U.S. state temperature extremes The climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is distant from the ocean. North of Lake Okeechobee, the prevalent climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa), while coastal areas south of the lake (including the Florida Keys) have a true tropical climate (Köppen: Aw).[25] Mean high temperatures for late July are primarily in the low 90s Fahrenheit (32–34 °C). Mean low temperatures for early to mid January range from the low 40s Fahrenheit (4–7 °C) in northern Florida to above 60 °F (16 °C) from Miami on southward. With an average daily temperature of 70.7 °F (21.5 °C), it is the warmest state in the country.[26] In the summer, high temperatures in the state seldom exceed 100 °F (38 °C). Several record cold maxima have been in the 30s °F (−1 to 4 °C) and record lows have been in the 10s (−12 to −7 °C). These temperatures normally extend at most a few days at a time in the northern and central parts of Florida. Southern Florida, however, rarely encounters freezing temperatures. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Florida was 109 °F (43 °C), which was set on June 29, 1931 in Monticello. The coldest temperature was −2 °F (−19 °C), on February 13, 1899, just 25 miles (40 km) away, in Tallahassee. Due to its subtropical climate, Florida rarely receives snow. However, on rare occasions, a combination of cold moisture and freezing temperatures can result in snowfall. Frost is more common than snow, occurring several times during the winter months. The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range from zone 8a (no colder than 10 °F or −12 °C) in the inland western panhandle to zone 11b (no colder than 45 °F or 7 °C) in the lower Florida Keys.[27]    Average high and low temperatures for various Florida cities   City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec   Jacksonville[28] 65/42 68/45 74/50 79/55 86/63 90/70 92/73 91/73 87/69 80/61 74/51 67/44   Miami[29] 76/60 78/62 80/65 83/68 87/73 89/76 91/77 91/77 89/76 86/73 82/68 78/63   Orlando[30] 71/49 74/52 78/56 83/60 88/66 91/72 92/74 92/74 90/73 85/66 78/59 73/52   Pensacola[31] 61/43 64/46 70/51 76/58 84/66 89/72 90/74 90/74 87/70 80/60 70/50 63/45   Tallahassee[32] 64/39 68/42 74/47 80/52 87/62 91/70 92/72 92/72 89/68 82/57 73/48 66/41   Tampa[33] 70/51 73/54 77/58 81/62 88/69 90/74 90/75 91/76 89/74 85/67 78/60 72/54    Florida's nickname is the "Sunshine State", but severe weather is a common occurrence in the state. Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the United States, as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country.[34] Florida has one of the highest average precipitation levels of any state,[35] in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in much of the state from late spring until early autumn. A narrow eastern part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. The rest of the state, including Miami, receives between 2,800 and 3,200 hours annually.[36] Florida leads the United States in tornadoes per area (when including waterspouts)[37] but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and Great Plains. Hail often accompanies the most severe thunderstorms. Hurricanes pose a severe threat each year during the June 1 to November 30 hurricane season, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas.[38] From 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above.[38] It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm. Florida was the site of what was then the costliest weather disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Andrew, which caused more than $25 billion in damage when it struck in August 1992; it held that distinction until 2005, when Hurricane Katrina surpassed it. Hurricane Wilma — the second most expensive hurricane in Florida history — landed just south of Marco Island in October 2004.[39][40]        Hurricane Andrew bearing down on Florida on August 23, 1992.

Fauna Further information: List of mammals of Florida and Snakes of Florida     An alligator in the Florida Everglades.   Florida is host to many types of wildlife including:  Marine mammals: bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, North Atlantic right whale, West Indian manatee   Mammals: Florida panther, northern river otter, mink, eastern cottontail rabbit, marsh rabbit, raccoon, striped skunk, squirrel, white-tailed deer, Key deer, bobcats, gray fox, coyote, wild boar, Florida black bear, nine-banded armadillos, Virginia opossum   Reptiles: eastern diamondback and pygmy rattlesnakes, gopher tortoise, green and leatherback sea turtles, and eastern indigo snake. In 2012, there were about one million American alligators and 1,500 crocodiles.[41]   Birds: peregrine falcon,[42] bald eagle, northern caracara, snail kite, osprey, white and brown pelicans, sea gulls, whooping and sandhill cranes, roseate spoonbill, Florida scrub jay (state endemic), and others. One subspecies of wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, namely subspecies osceola, is found only in Florida.[43] The state is a wintering location for many species of eastern North American birds.  As a result of climate change, there have been small numbers of several new species normally native to cooler areas to the north: snowy owls, snow buntings, harlequin ducks, and razorbills. These have been seen in the northern part of the state.[44]     Invertebrates: carpenter ants, termites, American cockroach, Africanized bees, the Miami blue butterfly, and the grizzled mantis.  The only known calving area for the northern right whale is off the coasts of Florida and Georgia.[45] The native bear population has risen from a historic low of 300 in the 1970s, to 3,000 in 2011.[46] Since their accidental importation from South America into North America in the 1930s, the red imported fire ant population has increased its territorial range to include most of the Southern United States, including Florida. They are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting.[47] A number of non-native snakes and lizards have been released in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and Indian pythons, African rock pythons, green anacondas, and Nile monitor lizards.[48] Green iguanas have also established a firm population in the southern part of the state. There are about 500,000 feral pigs in Florida.[49]        Key deer in the lower Florida Keys          The Florida scrub jay is found only in Florida.          West Indian manatee          Florida panther, native of South Florida          Leatherback sea turtle          Whooping crane     Flora There are about 3,000 different types of wildflowers in Florida. This is the third most diverse state in the union, behind California and Texas, both larger states.[50] On the east coast of the state, mangroves have normally dominated the coast from Cocoa Beach southward; salt marshes from St. Augustine northward. From St. Augustine south to Cocoa Beach, the coast fluctuates between the two, depending on the annual weather conditions.[44]        Everglades National Park in Southern Florida          Bahia Honda in the Florida Keys          Ocala National Forest in North Central Florida          Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Northeast Florida     Environmental issues     The beaches of Key Biscayne in Miami.   Main article: Environment of Florida Florida is a low per capita energy user.[51] It is estimated that approximately 4% of energy in the state is generated through renewable resources.[52] Florida's energy production is 6% of the nation's total energy output, while total production of pollutants is lower, with figures of 5.6% for nitrogen oxide, 5.1% for carbon dioxide, and 3.5% for sulfur dioxide.[52] All potable water resources have been controlled by the state government through five regional water authorities since 1972.[53] Red tide has been an issue on the southwest coast of Florida, as well as other areas. While there has been a great deal of conjecture over the cause of the toxic algae bloom, there is no evidence that it is being caused by pollution or that there has been an increase in the duration or frequency of red tides.[54] The Florida panther is close to extinction. A record 23 were killed in 2009 predominately by automobile collisions, leaving about 100 individuals in the wild. The Center for Biological Diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established.[55] Manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction. Much of Florida has an elevation of less than 12 feet (less than 3.7 meters), including populated areas such as Miami which are located on the coast. Miami and other parts of south Florida are the most vulnerable regions in the world to rising sea levels associated with global warming.[56] The Atlantic beaches that are vital to the state's economy are being washed out to sea due to rising sea levels caused by climate change and the state is running out of accessible offshore sand reserves.[57] Geology Main article: Geology of Florida The Florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the Florida Platform. The largest deposits of potash in the United States are found in Florida.[58] Extended systems of underwater caves, sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents. The limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell. During the last glacial period, lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula, largely savanna.[59] The Everglades, an enormously wide, slow-flowing river encompasses the southern tip of the peninsula. Sinkhole damage claims on property in the state exceeded a total of $2 billion from 2006 through 2010.[60] Florida is tied for last place as having the fewest earthquakes of any U.S. state.[61][62] Earthquakes are rare because Florida is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries.

The center of population has moved less than 5 miles (8 km) to the east and approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north between 1980 and 2010 and has been located in Polk County since the 1960 census.[67] The population exceeded 19.7 million by December 2014, surpassing the population of the state of New York for the first time.[68] Florida contains the highest percentage of people over 65 (17%).[69] There were 186,102 military retirees living in the state in 2008.[70] About two-thirds of the population was born in another state, the second highest in the country.[71] In 2010, illegal immigrants constituted an estimated 5.7% of the population. This was the sixth highest percentage of any state in the country.[72][73] There were an estimated 675,000 illegal immigrants in the state in 2010.[74] A 2013 Gallup poll indicated that 47% of the residents agreed that Florida was the best state to live in. Results in other states ranged from a low of 18% to a high of 77%.[75] Municipalities and metropolitan areas See also: List of urbanized areas in Florida (by population), Florida statistical areas, List of municipalities in Florida and Florida locations by per capita income The legal name in Florida for a city, town or village is "municipality". In Florida there is no legal difference between towns, villages and cities.[76] In 2012, 75% of the population lived within 10 miles (16 km) of the coastline.[77]        v t e   Largest cities or towns in Florida Source:[78]     Rank Name County Pop.

The largest metropolitan area in the state as well as the entire southeastern United States is the Miami metropolitan area, with about 5.8 million people. The Tampa Bay Area, with over 2.8 million people, is the second largest; the Orlando metropolitan area, with over 2.2 million people, is the third; and the Jacksonville metropolitan area, with over 1.3 million people, is fourth. Florida has 22 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 43 of Florida's 67 counties are in a MSA.

They were followed by Irish at 1,617,433.     Cuban men playing dominos in Miami's Little Havana. In 2000, Cubans made up 34% of Miami's population and 5% of Florida's.[90]   White Americans of all European backgrounds are present in all areas of the state. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were nearly 80% of Florida's population.[91] Those of English and Irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas across the state. Some native white Floridians, especially those who have descended from long-time Florida families, may refer to themselves as "Florida crackers"; others see the term as a derogatory one. Like whites in most of the other Southern states, they descend mainly from English and Scots-Irish settlers, as well as some other British settlers.[92] Florida's Hispanic population includes large communities of Cuban Americans in Miami and Tampa, Puerto Ricans in Orlando and Tampa, and Central American migrant workers in inland West-Central and South Florida.[citation needed] The Hispanic community continues to grow more affluent and mobile. As of 2011, 57.0% of Florida's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[93] Before the American Civil War, when slavery was legal, and during the Reconstruction Era that followed, blacks made up nearly half of the state's population.[94] Their proportion declined over the next century, as many moved north in the Great Migration while large numbers of northern whites moved to the state. Recently,[when?] the state's proportion of black residents has begun to grow again.[citation needed] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern Florida (notably in Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tallahassee, and Pensacola), the Tampa Bay area, the Orlando area, especially in Orlando and Sanford. In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. Given migration of other groups into Florida, by 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%.[95] Languages     20% of Floridians speak Spanish, the second most widely-spoken language.   See also: Demographics of Florida § Languages and Miami accent The most common languages spoken in Florida are English and Spanish. English is the state's official language, a position that was added to the Florida Constitution in 1988 in response to the state's growing Spanish-speaking Hispanic population. But 27% of Florida's population speaks a mother language other than English, and over 200 first languages other than English are spoken at home in the state.[96][97] The most common languages spoken in Florida as a first language in 2010 are:[96]  73% — English 20% — Spanish 2% — French Creole No other language is spoken by more than 1% of the state's population  The most common accent throughout Florida is general American English, but there are a variety of English-language accents and dialects in Florida. Southern accents are common in northern Florida, while due to migration patterns, the east coast of Florida has a northeastern accent and the west coast of Florida has a midwestern accent. Religion     Miami Cathedral of Saint Mary. Roman Catholicism the largest religious denomination in the state.   In 2010, the three largest denominational groups in Florida were the Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the United Methodist Church.[98] Florida is mostly Protestant, but Roman Catholicism is the single largest denomination in the state, due in significant part to the state's large Hispanic population. There is also a sizable Jewish community, located mainly in South Florida; this is the largest Jewish population in the South and the third largest in the country behind New York and California.[99] Florida's current religious affiliations include Protestants at 48%, Roman Catholics at 26%, Jews at 3%, Jehovah's Witnesses at 1%, Muslim at 1%, Orthodox at 1%, Buddhists at 0.5% and Hindus at 0.5%. Atheists, deists, and other non-religious people compose 16% of Florida's population.[100] Governance Main article: Government of Florida See also: List of Florida Governors, United States Congressional Delegations from Florida and Florida Cabinet     Florida Capitol buildings   The basic structure, duties, function, and operations of the government of the state of Florida are defined and established by the Florida Constitution, which establishes the basic law of the state and guarantees various rights and freedoms of the people. The state government consists of three separate branches: judicial, executive, and legislative. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed by the governor, become law. The Florida Legislature comprises the Florida Senate, which has 40 members, and the Florida House of Representatives, which has 120 members. The current Governor of Florida is Rick Scott. The Florida Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and six Justices. Florida has 67 counties. Some reference materials may show only 66 because Duval County is consolidated with the City of Jacksonville. There are 379 cities in Florida (out of 411) that report regularly to the Florida Department of Revenue, but there are other incorporated municipalities that do not. The state government's primary source of revenue is sales tax. Florida does not impose a personal income tax. The primary revenue source for cities and counties is property tax. There were 800 federal corruption convictions from 1988 to 2007, more than any other state.[101] Elections history Further information: Politics of Florida, Elections in Florida, and Political party strength in Florida Although most voters are registered Democrats, since 1952 the state has voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for the 1964, 1976, and 1996 elections, when the Democrat was from the South, and the 2008 and 2012 elections, when the Democrat was from the North. 2008 marked the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt that Florida had voted for a Northern Democrat. The first post-reconstruction Republican congressional representative was elected in 1954.[102] The state's first post-reconstruction Republican senator was elected in 1968,[103] two years after the first post-reconstruction Republican governor.[104] The state is considered a bellwether, voting for 13 successful presidential candidates since 1952, and for the loser three times.[105]  Presidential elections results  Year Republican Democratic   2012 49.13% 4,163,447 50.01% 4,237,756   2008 48.22% 4,045,624 51.03% 4,282,074   2004 52.10% 3,964,522 47.09% 3,583,544   2000 48.85% 2,912,790 48.84% 2,912,253   1996 42.32% 2,244,536 48.02% 2,546,870   1992 40.89% 2,173,310 39.00% 2,072,698   1988 60.87% 2,618,885 38.51% 1,656,701   1984 65.32% 2,730,350 34.66% 1,448,816   1980 55.52% 2,046,951 38.50% 1,419,475   1976 46.64% 1,469,531 51.93% 1,636,000   1972 71.91% 1,857,759 27.80% 718,117   1968 40.53% 886,804 30.93% 676,794   1964 48.85% 905,941 51.15% 948,540   1960 51.51% 795,476 48.49% 748,700   In 1998, Democratic voters were most dominant in areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities as well as transplanted white liberals who primarily came from the northeastern United States.[106] South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area was a good example, as it had a particularly high level of both racial minorities and white liberals. Because of this, the area has voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. The Daytona Beach area has been, to a lesser extent, somewhat similar to South Florida demographically and the city of Orlando had a large Hispanic population, which often favored Democrats. Republicans remain dominant throughout much of the rest of Florida particularly in the more rural and suburban areas, as is the case throughout the Deep South.[106] The fast-growing I-4 corridor area, which runs through Central Florida and connects the cities of Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, had a fairly similar number of both Republican and Democratic voters. The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. In recent times, whichever way the I-4 corridor area, containing 40% of Florida voters, votes has often determined who will win the state of Florida in presidential elections.[107] The Democratic Party has maintained an edge in voter registration, both statewide and in 40 of the 67 counties, including Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County, the state's three most populous counties.[108] Recent elections Main article: United States presidential election in Florida, 2000 In 2000, George W. Bush won the U.S. Presidential election by a margin of 271–266 in the Electoral College.[109] Of the 271 electoral votes for Bush, 25 were cast by electors from Florida.[110] Reapportionment following the 2000 United States Census gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives.[111] Despite the Democratic advantage in registration, a safe Senate seat and Obama winning the state, as of 2008, Republicans controlled the governorship and most other statewide elective offices and 17 of the state's 27 seats in the House of Representatives.[112] Florida has been listed as a swing state in Presidential elections since 1950, voting for the losing candidate once in that period of time.[113] In the closely contested 2000 election the state played a pivotal role.[109][110][114][115][116][117] In 2008, delegates of both the Republican Florida primary election and Democratic Florida primary election were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met in August due to violation of both parties' national rules. In the 2010 elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning the governor's mansion, maintaining firm majorities in both houses of the state legislature. They won four previously Democratic-held seats to create a 19–6 Republican majority delegation representing Florida in the federal House of Representatives. As a result of the 2010 United States Census, Florida gained two House of Representative seats in 2012.[111] Statutes See also: Law of Florida     The Florida Supreme Court   The state repealed mandatory auto inspection in 1981.[118] In 1972, the state made personal injury protection auto insurance mandatory for drivers, becoming the second in the nation to enact a no-fault insurance law. The ease of receiving payments under this law is seen as precipitating a major increase in insurance fraud.[119] Auto insurance fraud was the highest in the nation in 2011, estimated at close to $1 billion.[120] Fraud is particularly centered in the Miami-Dade metropolitan and Tampa areas.[121][122][123] Law enforcement Further information: List of law enforcement agencies in Florida and Crime in Florida Florida was ranked the fifth most dangerous state in 2009. Ranking was based on the record of serious felonies committed in 2008.[124] The state was the sixth highest scammed state in 2010. It ranked first in mortgage fraud in 2009.[125] In 2009, 44% of highway fatalities involved alcohol.[126] Florida is one of seven states that prohibit the open carry of handguns. This law was passed in 1987.[127] According to the Federal Trade Commission, Florida has the highest per capita rate of both reported fraud and other types of complaints and reported including identity theft complaints.[128] Economy     Launch of Space Shuttle Columbia from the Kennedy Space Center       The Brickell Financial District in Miami contains the largest concentration of international banks in the United States.[129][130]   In the twentieth century, tourism, industry, construction, international banking, biomedical and life sciences, healthcare research, simulation training, aerospace and defense, and commercial space travel have contributed to the state's economic development.[citation needed] The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Florida in 2010 was $748 billion.[131] Its GDP is the fourth largest economy in the United States.[132] In 2010, it became the fourth largest exporter of trade goods.[133] The major contributors to the state's gross output in 2007 were general services, financial services, trade, transportation and public utilities, manufacturing and construction respectively. In 2010–11, the state budget was $70.5 billion, having reached a high of $73.8 billion in 2006–07.[134] Chief Executive Magazine name Florida the third "Best State for Business" in 2011.[135] The economy is driven almost entirely by its nineteen metropolitan areas. In 2004, they had a combined total of 95.7% of the state's domestic product.[136] Personal income See also: Florida locations by per capita income In 2011, Florida's per capita personal income was $39,563, ranking 27th in the nation.[137] In February 2011, the state's unemployment rate was 11.5%.[138] Florida is one of seven states that do not impose a personal income tax. Florida's constitution establishes a state minimum wage that (unique among minimum wage laws) is adjusted for inflation annually. As of January 1, 2015, Florida's minimum wage was $5.03 for tipped positions, and $8.05 for non-tipped positions, which was higher than the federal rate of $7.25.[139] Florida has 4 cities in the top 25 cities in the country with the most credit card debt.[140] The state also had the second-highest credit card delinquency rate, with 1.45% of cardholders in the state more than 90 days delinquent on one or more credit cards.[141] There were 2.4 million Floridians living in poverty in 2008. 18.4% of children 18 and younger were living in poverty.[142] Miami is the sixth poorest big city in the United States.[143] In 2010, over 2.5 million Floridians were on food stamps, up from 1.2 million in 2007. To qualify, Floridians must make less than 133% of the federal poverty level, which would be under $29,000 for a family of four.[144] Real estate In the early 20th century, land speculators discovered Florida, and businessmen such as Henry Plant and Henry Flagler developed railroad systems, which led people to move in, drawn by the weather and local economies. From then on, tourism boomed, fueling a cycle of development that overwhelmed a great deal of farmland. Because of the collective effect on the insurance industry of the hurricane claims of 2004, homeowners insurance has risen 40% to 60% and deductibles have risen.[39] At the end of the third quarter in 2008, Florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the country, with 7.8% of mortgages delinquent at least 60 days.[141] A 2009 list of national housing markets that were hard hit in the real estate crash included a disproportionate number in Florida.[145] The early 21st-century building boom left Florida with 300,000 vacant homes in 2009, according to state figures.[146] In 2009, the US Census Bureau estimated that Floridians spent an average 49.1% of personal income on housing-related costs, the third highest percentage in the country.[147] In the third quarter of 2009, there were 278,189 delinquent loans, 80,327 foreclosures.[148] Sales of existing homes for February 2010 was 11,890, up 21% from the same month in 2009. Only two metropolitan areas showed a decrease in homes sold: Panama City and Brevard County. The average sales price for an existing house was $131,000, 7% decrease from the prior year.[149][dubious – discuss] Tourism     The Port of Miami is the world's largest cruise ship port.       Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.   Tourism makes up the largest sector of the state economy.[citation needed] Warm weather, sunshine, and hundreds of miles of beaches attract about 60 million visitors to the state every year. Florida was the top destination state in 2011.[150] Many beach towns are popular tourist destinations, particularly during winter and spring break. Twenty-three million tourists visited Florida beaches in 2000, spending $22 billion.[151] The public has a right to beach access under the public trust doctrine, but some areas have access effectively blocked by private owners for a long distance.[152] Amusement parks, especially in the Greater Orlando area, make up a significant portion of tourism. The Walt Disney World Resort is the largest vacation resort in the world,[citation needed] consisting of four theme parks and more than 20 hotels. Other major parks include Universal Orlando Resort, Busch Gardens, and SeaWorld. Agriculture and fishing     Oranges in Florida.   Agriculture is the second largest industry in the state. Citrus fruit, especially oranges, are a major part of the economy, and Florida produces the majority of citrus fruit grown in the United States. In 2006, 67% of all citrus, 74% of oranges, 58% of tangerines, and 54% of grapefruit were grown in Florida. About 95% of commercial orange production in the state is destined for processing (mostly as orange juice, the official state beverage).[153] Citrus canker continues to be an issue of concern. From 1997 to 2013, the growing of citrus trees has declined 25%, from 600,000 acres (240,000 ha) to 450,000 acres (180,000 ha). Citrus greening disease is incurable. A study states that it has caused the loss of $4.5 billion between 2006 and 2012. As of 2014, it was the major agricultural concern.[154] Other products include sugarcane, strawberries, tomatoes and celery.[155] The state is the largest producer of sweet corn and green beans for the country.[156] The Everglades Agricultural Area is a major center for agriculture. The environmental impact of agriculture, especially water pollution, is a major issue in Florida today. In 2009, fishing was a $6 billion industry, employing 60,000 jobs for sports and commercial purposes.[157] Industry     The Miami Civic Center has the second-largest concentration of medical and research facilities in the United States.[158]   Florida is the leading state for sales of power boats. There were $1.96 billion worth of boats sold in 2013.[159] Phosphate mining, concentrated in the Bone Valley, is the state's third-largest industry. The state produces about 75% of the phosphate required by farmers in the United States and 25% of the world supply, with about 95% used for agriculture (90% for fertilizer and 5% for livestock feed supplements) and 5% used for other products.[160] After the watershed events of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the state of Florida began investing in economic development through the Office of Trade, Tourism, and Economic Development. Governor Jeb Bush realized that watershed events such as Andrew negatively impacted Florida's backbone industry of tourism severely. The office was directed to target Medical/Bio-Sciences among others. Three years later, The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) announced it had chosen Florida for its newest expansion. In 2003, TSRI announced plans to establish a major science center in Palm Beach, a 364,000 square feet (33,800 m2) facility on 100 acres (40 ha), which TSRI planned to occupy in 2006.[161] Government Since the arrival of the NASA Merritt Island launch sites on Cape Canaveral (most notably Kennedy Space Center) in 1962, Florida has developed a sizable aerospace industry. Another major economic engine in Florida is the United States Military. There are 24 military bases in the state, housing three Unified Combatant Commands; United States Central Command in Tampa, United States Southern Command in Doral, and United States Special Operations Command in Tampa. There are 109,390 U.S. military personnel stationed in Florida,[162] contributing, directly and indirectly, $52 billion a year to the state's economy.[163] In 2009, there were 89,706 federal workers employed within the state.[164] In 2012, government was a top employer in all counties in the state. This was mainly due to the prevalence of teachers, whose school boards employ nearly 1 out of every 30 workers in the state. The military was the top employer in three counties.[165] Health There were 2.7 million Medicaid patients in Florida in 2009. The governor has proposed adding $2.6 billion to care for the expected 300,000 additional patients in 2011.[166] The cost of caring for 2.3 million clients in 2010 was $18.8 billion.[167] This is nearly 30% of Florida's budget.[168] Medicaid paid for 60% of all births in Florida in 2009.[40] The state has a program for those not covered by Medicaid. In 2013, Florida refused to participate in providing coverage for the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act, popularly called Obamacare. Florida also refused to accept additional Federal funding for Medicaid. As a result, Florida is second only to Texas in percentage of its citizens without health insurance.[169] Some people suffer from various allergies from plants at varying seasons including pollen from oak trees and juniper shrubs.[170] Architecture     Miami Art Deco District, built during the 1920s-1930s.   While many houses and commercial buildings look similar to those elsewhere in the country, the state has appropriated some unique styles in some section of the state including Spanish revival, Florida vernacular, and Mediterranean Revival Style.[171][172] It also has the largest collection of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in both the United States and the entire world, most of which are located in the Miami metropolitan area, especially Miami Beach's Art Deco District.[173] Another unique architectural design found only in Florida is the Miami Modern, which can be seen along places such as Miami's MiMo Historic District. Education Main article: Education in Florida Primary and secondary education Florida's public primary and secondary schools are administered by the Florida Department of Education. School districts are organized within county boundaries. Each school district has an elected Board of Education which sets policy, budget, goals, and approves expenditures. Management is the responsibility of a Superintendent of schools. The Florida Department of Education is required by law to train educators in teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).[174] Universities The State University System of Florida was founded in 1905, and is governed by the Florida Board of Governors. During the 2010 academic year, 312,216 students attended one of these twelve universities. The Florida College System comprises 28 public community and state colleges. In 2011-12, enrollment consisted of more than 875,000 students.[175] Florida's first private university, Stetson University, was founded in 1883. The Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida is an association of 28 private, educational institutions in the state.[176] This Association reported that their member institutions served over 121,000 students in the fall of 2006.[177]        Florida State University Tallahassee          University of Florida Gainesville          Florida Gulf Coast University Fort Myers          Flagler College Saint Augustine          University of Miami Coral Gables     Transportation Main article: Transportation in Florida     Florida's Turnpike   Highways Further information: State Roads in Florida Florida's highway system contains 1,473 mi (2,371 km) of interstate highway, and 9,934 mi (15,987 km) of non-interstate highway, such as state highways and U.S. Highways. Florida's interstates, state highways, and U.S. Highways are maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation. In 2011, there were about 9,000 retail gas stations in the state. Floridians consume 21 million gallons of gasoline daily, ranking it third in national use.[178][179] Motorists have the 45th lowest rate of car insurance in the country. 24% are uninsured.[180] Drivers between 15 and 19 years of age averaged 364 car crashes a year per ten thousand licensed Florida drivers in 2010. Drivers 70 and older averaged 95 per 10,000 during the same time frame. A spokesperson for the non-profit Insurance Institute said that "Older drivers are more of a threat to themselves."[181] Before the construction of routes under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Florida began construction of a long cross-state toll road, Florida's Turnpike. The first section, from Fort Pierce south to the Golden Glades Interchange was completed in 1957. After a second section north through Orlando to Wildwood (near present-day The Villages), and a southward extension around Miami to Homestead, it was finished in 1974. Florida's primary interstate routes include:   I-4, which bisects the state, connecting Tampa, Lakeland, Orlando, and Daytona Beach, connecting with I-75 in Tampa and I-95 in Daytona Beach.  I‑10, which traverses the panhandle, connecting Pensacola, Tallahassee, Lake City, and Jacksonville, with interchanges with I-75 in Lake City and I-95 in Jacksonville.

This West Palm Beach Station serves Amtrak and Tri-Rail commuter rail service.   Florida is served by Amtrak, operating numerous lines throughout, connecting the state's largest cities to points north in the United States and Canada. The busiest Amtrak train stations in Florida in 2011 were: Sanford (259,944), Orlando (179,142), Tampa Union Station (140,785), Miami (94,556), and Jacksonville (74,733).[183] Sanford, in Greater Orlando, is the southern terminus of the Auto Train, which originates at Lorton, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C..

Miami Central Station, the city's rapid transit, commuter rail, intercity rail, and bus hub, is under construction. The Florida Department of Transportation was preparing to build a high-speed rail between Tampa, Lakeland and Orlando.[184] This was to be the first phase of the Florida High Speed Rail system.[185] Soil work began in July 2010[186][187] and construction of the line was slated to begin in 2011, with the initial Tampa-Orlando phase completed by 2014.[188] The second phase, would have extended the line to Miami. Governor Scott, however, refused federal funds and the project has been canceled. All Aboard Florida is a proposed higher-speed rail service that would run between Orlando and Miami at speeds up to 125 mph. Its Miami to Cocoa portion is scheduled to open in 2016, with the final segment to Orlando opening in 2017. Public transit     The Miami Metrorail is the state's only rapid transit system.
