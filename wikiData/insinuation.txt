For other uses, see Innuendo (disambiguation).    Look up innuendo in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.   An innuendo is an insinuation or intimation about a person or thing, especially of a disparaging or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging (also called insinuation), that works obliquely by allusion. In the latter sense the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent. According to the Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary, an innuendo is "an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude; the use of remarks like this: innuendoes about her private life or The song is full of sexual innuendo." The word is often used to express disapproval.[1] The term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: "We need to go deeper" can be seen as both a request for further inquiry on any given issue or a request to go deeper into an orifice. Alternatively, the simple changing of the pronunciation of a word can be used to make it sound vulgar e.g. innuendo to "in-your-endo", with "endo"'s referring to that person's intimate part.

Many television shows aimed at a younger audience frequently use innuendos as a way of attracting older viewers without offending their network's censorship. Many American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue. Shows such as The Simpsons, Futurama, Son of the Beach, The Office, King of The Hill, House, Beavis and Butt-head, Everybody Hates Chris, George Lopez, American Dad!, Tosh.0, and especially Family Guy and South Park have done this.[citation needed] Also, many radio shows, including the Bobby Bones Show, the Rick and Bubba Show, The Gallo Radio Show, and most of the songs played on Southern Crossroads are notable for this.[citation needed] A character in the American sitcom Scrubs, The Todd, is known for his constant innuendo, even shown waiting around corners for "set ups", opportunities to make innuendos. On The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo".
