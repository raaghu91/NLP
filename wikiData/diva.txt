It is derived from the Italian noun diva, a female deity. The plural of the word in English is "divas"; in Italian, dive [ˈdiːve]. The basic sense of the term is goddess,[1][2] the feminine of the Latin word divus (Italian divo), someone deified after death, or Latin deus, a god.[3] The male form divo exists in Italian and is usually reserved for the most prominent leading tenors, like Enrico Caruso and Beniamino Gigli. The Italian term divismo describes the star-making system in the film industry. In contemporary Italian, diva and divo simply denote much-admired celebrities, especially film actresses and actors, and can be translated as "(film) star". The Italian actress Lyda Borelli is considered the first cinematic diva, following her breakthrough role in Love Everlasting (1913).[4] An extravagant admiration for divas is a common element of camp culture.[5] Modern usage[edit] The word diva re-emerged in the early 1990s when singer Annie Lennox named her first post-Eurythmics album Diva. Since that, the word has often been used to describe a female artist who achieved enormous success. The term reached new status in popular culture when, in 1998, VH1 debuted its first annual VH1 Divas concert in support of VH1's Save The Music Foundation. The concert event brought together five of the world's most celebrated divas: Mariah Carey,Whitney Houston, Gloria Estefan, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin, and Shania Twain.
