Their 1999 debut album, Creamy, made when the pair were just thirteen years of age, was composed of euro-pop versions of children’s songs. In 2001, they released a seasonal album, Christmas Snow. Their only single in the UK was a euro-pop cover of the theme song to the 1984 movie, Neverending Story, which was featured on their second album, We Got the Time. They were signed to RecArt Music Denmark. Their album, "We Got the Time" was produced by Ole Evenrud, of A*Teens fame.[1] Ole Evenrud also produced a version of a song from that album, "Help! I'm a Fish (I'm a Little Yellow Fish)", for the Danish pop group, Little Trees. After their appearance on Dancemania Speed 10 with a speedy remix of their song "I Do I Do I Do" in late 2002, Creamy appeared on this eurodance compilation series, Dancemania, several times.[2]    Contents   1 Discography  1.1 Studio albums 1.2 Singles   2 References 3 External links    Discography[edit] Studio albums[edit]   Title Year Peak chart positions   DEN [3]   Creamy 1999 1   We Got the Time 2000 2   Christmas Snow 2001 27   "—" indicates the album was not released or failed to chart in that country.
