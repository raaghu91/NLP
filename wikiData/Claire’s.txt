To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[6]    Contents   1 History 2 Offices  2.1 Illinois office 2.2 Florida office   3 Store types 4 Merchandise 5 References 6 External links    History[edit]    This section requires expansion. (June 2013)   1961: Founded as Fashion Tress Industries by Rowland Schaefer. FTI focused on wigs, and became the world's largest retailer of fashion wigs.[7] 1973: Fashion Tress acquired Claire's, a 25-store jewelry chain, and shifted focus away from wigs to a full line of fashion jewelry and accessories. The new firm was named Claire's Stores, Inc.[7] 1978: Claire's began providing ear piercing services. 1980: Established a Hong Kong based sourcing office. 1980s: Claire's continues store expansion throughout the United States. 1989: Bought Topkapi, a Japanese chain with 16 stores[7] 1995: Bought Bow Bangles, a British chain with 71 stores in England, Wales, and Scotland.[8] 1996: Bought The Icing, an American chain with 85 stores. This would become the company's primary brand for women in their 20s.[7] 1996: Bought Accessory Place, an American chain with 31 stores.[7] 1998: Bought Bijoux One, a Swiss chain.[9] 1999: Bought Cleopatre, a privately owned chain based in Paris with 42 stores, for $11 million in cash.[10] 1999: Bought Afterthoughts, which were converted to Icing stores[11] 2001: Launched claires.com 2005: Claire's Stores, Inc was listed on the NASDAQ. 2007: Taken private by private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a $3.1 billion leveraged buyout[12] 2008: Consolidated its European operations into one group, headquartered in Birmingham, UK. 2010: Opened its first stores in Ukraine. 2011: Launched e-commerce in the United States and opened its first stores in India and Mexico. 2012: Opened its first stores in China, Italy, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Honduras Offices[edit] As of 2014 Claire's has 6 offices:[3]  Hoffman Estates, Illinois (suburb of Chicago): Global HQ, North America HQ, North America Distribution Center Birmingham: Europe HQ, Europe Distribution Center Hong Kong: Sourcing & Buying, International Distribution Center Pembroke Pines, Florida (suburb of Miami): Accounting Paris: Field Support Madrid: Field Support  Claire's has two offices in the United States: one in Illinois and one in Florida.[13] The Illinois office is the location of the principal executive offices.[14][15] As of 1997 and since 1973, the CEO regularly commutes between Pembroke Pines and Hoffman Estates. As of 1996 Claire's also had offices in New York City and Hong Kong.[6] Illinois office[edit] Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, in Greater Chicago.[16][17] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[6][18] near Barrington Road.[18] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[6] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[19] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[6] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[6] Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[6] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[18] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[20] Florida office[edit] Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[21][22] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[23] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[6] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[19] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[23] Store types[edit]     A mall-based Claire's store in Alpena, Michigan       Claire's branch in Boulevard Saint Michel, Paris       Glendale, Queens, New York   There are two types of Claire's Boutique stores. One is a multi-million dollar store. Multi-million dollar stores accumulate one million dollars or more in a year. Some of these stores are located at Kenwood Mall in Cincinnati, OH, Monroe Crossing in Monroe, NC, Ashville Mall in Asheville,NC, and Westminster Mall in Westminster, CA. "[24][25] Claire's Stores operates under two brands: The majority of stores are of the Claire's store concept, and it is the only concept that operates outside North America. These stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages. The second brand is Icing. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics,21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise, giving the stores considerably less inventory, creating a less "over-stuffed" feel to customers.[26] Other variations of these stores exist, such as an Icing store on Halsted Street in Chicago with marble fixtures and a more "boutique" styling. Merchandise[edit] Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 12, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace and Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age. Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items. Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex 'gun'. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of two months with their second set of immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 13. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well. The store carries its own range of perfumes.
