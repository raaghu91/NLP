(February 2011)   This article is about the term Platitude.  For the Swedish progressive metal band Platitude, see Platitude (band).    Look up platitude in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.   A platitude is a trite, meaningless, or prosaic statement, generally directed at quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease. The word derives from plat, French word for "flat." Platitudes are geared towards presenting a shallow, unifying wisdom over a difficult topic. However, they are too overused and general to be anything more than undirected statements with ultimately little meaningful contribution towards a solution. Examples could be statements such as "Meet in the middle", "busy as a bee", "method to my madness", "better late than never", "Just be yourself", "burning the midnight oil" and "Nobody's perfect". Platitudes are generally a form of thought-terminating cliché.
