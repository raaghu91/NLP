It was available with either seven or nine seats. The biggest share of components was taken from the Nissan R'nessa, although it also has elements in common with its platform sharing twin, the Nissan Bassara. The Presage was exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships, and a larger companion to the Nissan Prairie. Engines include a 3.0-litre V6 VQ and a 2.4-litre four-cylinder KA gasoline engine, and a 2.5-litre four-cylinder YD turbodiesel engine. The YD turbodiesel & 2.4-litre KA were discontinued in August 2001 and replaced by a 2.5-litre four-cylinder QR gasoline engine. All rear seats can be folded, although only those in the second row can be removed. After the restyling in 2001, the Presage got a new trim level called Highway Star. The 2WD models feature the new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses electronic control to optimally distribute braking force to the front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a brake booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a load sensing valve (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the Braking Assist system.[2] Second generation: U31 (2003–2009)[edit]   second generation (U31)      Overview   Production 2003-2009   Body and chassis   Body style 5-door MPV   Layout FWD / AWD   Platform Nissan FF-L platform   Powertrain   Engine 3.5 L VQ35DE V6 2.5 L QR25DE I4   Transmission 4-speed automatic (E-ATX) CVT   Dimensions   Wheelbase 2,900 mm (114.2 in)   Length 4,870 mm (191.7 in)   Width 1,825 mm (71.9 in)   Height 1,695 mm (66.7 in)   Curb weight 1,860 kg (4,100 lb)   Chronology   Predecessor Nissan Largo   The second generation Presage debuted in 2003 with a transformable seven- or eight-seat configuration. Rear side doors were changed from swinging to sliding. The new Presage is built on the L-class platform, which is also used for the Teana mid-size car, and the North American Nissan Murano.     2003-2006 Nissan Presage X 3.5   Engines are also taken from the Teana, a 2.5-litre four-cylinder and a 3.5-litre V6 gasoline engine. These engines are mated with a four-speed automatic transmission or a sequential CVT. The main advantage of the second generation of this Japanese car is its comfortable and transformable interior. For easier reversing, there is a rear-view camera. As before, a sporty trim level dubbed Highway Star was available.
