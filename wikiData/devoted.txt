It was published and released to booksellers on October 11, 2011. It is the second in an unnamed trilogy by Duff and Allen. Since Sage was kidnapped, Clea has no way of knowing if he is alive or dead. And even though she has only just discovered they were soul mates, she feels like a part of her is lost forever. What's worse, she can't even turn to her best friend Ben because every time she looks at him, all she sees is his betrayal. But waiting for something to happen is not an option, so Clea is ready for action. Suffering through dreams of seeing Sage with another woman, she makes an uneasy alliance with Sage's enemies and sets out to be reunited with Sage...in this life or the next. Creation Process[edit] After the release of Elixir in 2010, Duff stated that she intended to write more in the series. She said, however, that nothing had been put down as yet and that she and her co-writer, Allen, were simply playing around with different ideas.[1] On October 18, 2010, Duff posted on Twitter about a sequel: "Can't believe so many people have read the book already! Yipeeee! Starting the next one in two weeks".[2] Devoted hit the book shelves on October 11, 2011.[3] In an interview with MTV, Duff said that "Devoted picks up basically where Elixir left off, and Clea has a lot of big questions to answer and decisions to make."[4] She also said that plans for the third and final book in the trilogy were being discussed and that "I don't think it will be as long. It will be a wrap up, kind of where they are now and what exactly happened to the Elixir, whose hands it's in, what ends up happening with Sage."[4] Paperback version and sequel[edit] Simon & Schuster announced that Devoted will be released in trade paperback on November 6, 2012.[4] Duff announced in July 2012 that the sequel and final novel in the Elixir series will be titled True and was released on April 16, 2013 by Simon & Schuster.[4] References[edit]   ^ "Hilary Duff Interview- seventeen.com".  ^ "Twitter / Hilary Duff: Can't believe so many people...".  ^ "Devoted".
