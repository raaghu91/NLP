In the second book it becomes clear that the soul Augustine wants to get to know is his own.[3] References[edit]   ^ Soliloquies: Augustine's Inner Dialogue by Boniface Ramsey 2000 ISBN 978-1-56548-142-8 page 1 ^ Augustine's Inner Dialogue: The Philosophical Soliloquy in Late Antiquity by Brian Stock 2010 ISBN 978-0-521-19031-2 page 6 ^ The Cambridge companion to Augustine by Eleonore Stump, Norman Kretzmann 2001 ISBN 0-521-65985-X page 76   External links[edit]   Works related to Text for the books of Soliloquies at Wikisource at Wikisource     This Christianity-related article is a stub.
