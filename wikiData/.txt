His fans—called "Chromies"—supported him at his races as "the people's horse". His owners, Perry Martin and Steve Coburn, named their partnership DAP Racing, standing for "Dumb Ass Partners"—inspired by a passerby who questioned their wisdom in purchasing the horse's dam. Critics did not think the colt, trained by Art Sherman and ridden by Victor Espinoza, could win the Kentucky Derby due to his humble origins and pedigree, but California Chrome defied the skeptics and won. After the Preakness, anticipation rose that he could win the Triple Crown in the 2014 Belmont Stakes. But in that race, California Chrome was stepped on by another horse at the start, tearing tissue from his heel, and finished fourth. Healing from his injury, he raced in the fall, running third in the Breeders' Cup Classic and winning the Hollywood Derby. He received the 2014 Secretariat Vox Populi Award, the NTRA Moment of the Year, and Eclipse Awards for Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and Horse of the Year. (Full article...)
