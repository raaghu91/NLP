Nussbaum argues that potentially not all forms of objectification are inherently negative act and that Objectification may not always be present when one of the 7 properties are present.[1] An internal criticism that Nussbaum made that is that the list needs more refinement in relation to other discourse and the many definitions of Autonomy and Subjectivity. Rae Langton's Additions[edit] Langton added to this list with:-[2]  Reduction to Body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;[2] Reduction to Appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;[2] Silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.[2]  Kantian Objectification[edit] Under Kantian Objectification to be objectified is a negative act and remove's one's own dignity Criticism[edit] Alan Soble questions the widely held Kantian view according to which human dignity is something that people have. He argues that objectification is not inappropriate. Everyone is already only an object and being only an object is not necessarily a bad thing. In one sense, then, no one can be objectified because no one has the higher ontological status that is required to be reduce-able by objectification. In another sense, everyone is vulnerable to objectification, and everyone can and may be objectified, because to do so is to take them to their correct ontological level. He writes:[3]  The claim that we should treat people as ‘persons’ and not dehumanise them is to reify, is to anthropomorphise humans and consider them more than they are. Do not treat people as objects, we are told. Why not? Because, goes the answer, people qua persons deserve not to be treated as objects. What a nice bit of illusory chauvinism. People are not as grand as we make them out to be, would like them to be, or hope them to be.[4]  See also[edit]  Sexual objectification Dehumanization Martha Nussbaum Kantian ethics Reification (Marxism)   External links[edit]    Look up objectification in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
