This article is about societal change.  For the punk EP, see The Decline.  For grammatical declining, see Declension. Decline involves change over time, for example:  from previously efficient to inefficient organizational functioning from previously rational to non-rational organizational and individual decision-making from previously law-abiding to law-violating organizational and individual behavior from previously virtuous to iniquitous individual moral behavior[citation needed]  Note: distinguish the noun decline from the adjective obsolete. Decline refers to the degenerating of something (compare obsolescence) whereas obsolete refers to the outdatedness of something or labels something as no longer in use. Decline represents the process of declining, a gradual sinking and wasting away. Social decline or moral decline is typically characterised[by whom?] as reduced adherence to cultural or social norms or values and widespread lapses in ethical behavior. Compare social decay.
