Margaret is a female first name, derived via French (Marguerite) and Latin (Margarita) from Greek Margarites, derived from the noun margaron meaning 'pearl'.[1] The Greek is closely related to the Sanskrit मञ्जरी mañjarī meaning 'pearl' or 'cluster of blossoms.'[2][3][4] Alternately, it might be of Persian origin, derived from the Persian language marvârid (مروارید), a pearl or daughter of light. Margaret has been an English name since the 11th century, and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages. It became less popular between the 16th century and 18th century, but became more common again after this period, becoming the second most popular name in the United States in 1903. Since this time, it has become less common, but is still the ninth most common name for women of all ages in the United States as of the 1990 census. It has a large number of diminutive forms in many different languages, including Maggie, Madge, Maisie, Marge, Meg, Megan, Mog, Rita, Daisy, Greta, Gretel, Gretchen, Magee, Marg, Margot, May, Molly, Peggy and Peg.[5]    Contents   1 Variant forms 2 Name Margaret in other languages 3 Nicknames of Margaret 4 Aristocrats  4.1 Austria 4.2 Belgium and the Netherlands (the Low Countries) 4.3 Denmark 4.4 England 4.5 France 4.6 Hungary 4.7 Norway 4.8 Scotland   5 Religious figures  5.1 Sainted 5.2 Beatified   6 Artists and authors 7 Educators and scientists 8 Other 9 Fictional characters 10 See also 11 References    Variant forms[edit] Alternate forms of Margaret, including short forms and pet names, include:   Annegret (German; short form of Johanna Margareta) Bitxi Basque Bitxilore Basque Gita (Czech) Gitka (Czech) Gituska (Czech) Gosia (Polish) Gośka (Polish) Greet (Dutch) Greetje (Dutch) Greta (English), (German), (Swedish) Gretchen (English), (German) Grete (Danish), (German) Gretel (German) Grethe (Danish), (German) Gretl (German) Gretta (English) Griet (Dutch) Grieta (Latvian) Jorie (English) Maarit (Finnish) Madge (English) Magali (Provencal) Mággá Sami Maggan (Swedish) Maggie (English) Mágredá Sami Magredá Sami Maighread (Scottish) Mairéad (Irish) Mairead (Scottish) Maisie (Scots) Makelesi (Tongan) Makkak Greenlandic ملغلره (Malghaləra) (Pashto) Małgorzata (Polish) Małgorzatka (Polish) Małgosia (Polish) Małgośka (Polish) Mamie (English) Manci (Hungarian) Mared (Welsh) Maret (Estonian) Máret Sami Marga (Estonian), (Catalan) Margalida (Catalan) Margaid (Manx) מרגלית Margalit (Hebrew) Margaréta (Hungarian), (Slovak) Margareta (Danish), (Dutch), (German), (Norwegian), (Romanian), (Slovene), (Swedish) Margarete (Estonian), (German) Margaretha (Dutch), German Margarethe (Danish), (German) Margaretta (English) Margarid (Armenian) Margarida (Galician), (Portuguese), (Catalan) Margarita (Bulgarian), (Greek), (Lithuanian), (Russian), (Spanish), (Ukrainian), (Albanian) Margaritis (Greek) Margaro (Greek) Margaux (French) Marge (English) Márge Sami Marged (Welsh) Margery (English) Margey (English) Márgget Sami Margherita (Italian) Margie (English) Margit Danish, (Hungarian), (Norwegian), (Swedish) Margita (Hungarian), (Polish) (Slovakian) Margo (English), (Greek), (Hungarian), (Ukrainian) Margot (English), (French), (German) Márgrehtá Sami Márgreittá Sami Margrét (Icelandic) Margret (German) Margrethe (Danish), (Norwegian) Margriet (Dutch) Margrit (German) Márgu Sami Marguerite (French) Margy (English) Marharyta Belarusian Marit (Norwegian), (Swedish) Marita (Finnish), (Greek) Maritta (Finnish), (Greek) Marja (Finnish) Marjatta (Finnish) Marjeta (Slovene), (Greek), (Albanian) Marjorie (English) Marjory (English), (Greek) Markéta (Czech) Marketta (Finnish) Markit (Czech) Marsaili (Scottish) Mayme (English) Meagan (English) Meaghan (English) Meg (English) Megi (Albanian) Megan (English), (Welsh) Meghan (English) Mererid (Welsh) Meret Sami Merete (Danish) Merit (Swedish) Meta (Danish), (German), (Norwegian), (Swedish) Mette (Danish), (Norwegian) Midge (English) Markétka (Czech) Mysie (Scots) Paaie (Manx) Peg (English) Pegeen (English), (Irish) Peggie (English) Peggy (English), (Greek) Peigi (Scottish) Penina (Hebrew) Perele (Yiddish) Perle (Yiddish) Reeta (Finnish) Reetta (Finnish) Rita (English), (Greek), (German), (Hungarian), (Italian), (Portuguese), (Russian), (Spanish), (Ukrainian) Tita (Spanish)   Name Margaret in other languages[edit]  Armenian -
