The particular meaning of the verb form given in the OED, "to speak for, to arrange for, engage beforehand: to ‘order’ (goods)”, is first cited from 1583. The adjective, "bespoken", meaning “ordered, commisioned, arranged for” is first quoted from 1607.[1] The term is generally more prevalent in British English, for example, bespoke jewellery (e.g. StyleRocks);[2] American English tends to use the word "custom" instead, as in custom car, custom motorcycle etc. Nevertheless, "bespoke" has seen increased usage in American English during the 21st century,[3] particularly in the phrase "bespoke suit."[4] Specific uses include:  Bespoke medicine, a movement to better fit treatment to the individual patient Bespoke software, software written to the specific requirement of a customer Bespoke tailoring, men's clothing made to the individual measurements of the customer Bespoke shoes, shoes that are made to fit the customer's specifications  References[edit]   ^ ”Bespeak” and “Bespoken”.
