These ingredients are usually arranged in layers.

In her recipe she instructed using hartshorn or bones of calves feet as the base ingredient for the jelly.[4] The poet Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote of trifles containing jelly in 1861.[5] Variations[edit] Trifles may contain a small amount of alcohol such as port, or, most commonly, sweet sherry or madeira wine. Non-alcoholic versions may use sweet juices or soft drinks such as ginger ale instead, as the liquid is necessary to moisten the cake. One popular trifle variant has the sponge soaked in jelly when the trifle is made, which sets when refrigerated. The cake and jelly bind together and produce a pleasant texture if made in the correct proportions. The Scots have a similar dish to trifle, Tipsy Laird, made with Drambuie or whisky.[6] In the Southern US, a variant of trifle is known as tipsy cake.     Layers of a trifle dessert.   A trifle is often used for decoration as well as taste, incorporating the bright, layered colours of the fruit, jelly, jam, and the contrast of the creamy yellow custard and white cream. Trifles are often served at Christmas time, sometimes as a lighter alternative to the much denser Christmas pudding. A Creole trifle (also sometimes known as a 'Russian cake' or a 'Russian Slab') is a different but related dessert item consisting of pieces of a variety of cakes mixed and packed firmly, moistened with alcohol (commonly red wine or rum) and a sweet syrup or fruit juice, and chilled. The resulting cake contains a variety of colour and flavour. Bakeries in New Orleans have been known to produce such cakes out of their left-over or imperfect baked goods.[citation needed] A similar dessert in Germany and Austria goes by the name of Punschtorte.[7] In Italy, a dessert similar to and probably based on trifle is known as zuppa inglese, meaning English Soup.
