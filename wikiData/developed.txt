Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.[1] Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. Developed countries have post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector. They are contrasted with developing countries, which are in the process of industrialization, or undeveloped countries, which are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian. According to the International Monetary Fund, advanced economies comprise 65.8% of global nominal GDP and 52.1% of global GDP (PPP) in 2010.[2] In 2014, the ten largest advanced economies by nominal GDP were the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Spain. By PPP GDP, they were the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea, Canada, Spain and Australia.[3]    Contents   1 Similar terms 2 Definition and criteria 3 Human Development Index (HDI) 4 Net take-home pay of OECD members 5 Gallup median household and per-capita income 6 Other lists of developed countries  6.1 IMF advanced economies 6.2 High-income OECD members  6.2.1 Development Assistance Committee members   6.3 Newsweek's "world's best countries"   7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links    Similar terms[edit] See also: North–South divide Terms similar to developed country include "advanced country", "industrialized country", "'more developed country" (MDC), "more economically developed country" (MEDC), "Global North country", "first world country", and "post-industrial country". The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as industrialization is an ongoing process that is hard to define. The first industrialized country was the United Kingdom, followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to Germany, United States, France and other Western European countries. According to some economists such as Jeffrey Sachs, however, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.[4] Definition and criteria[edit] Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is income per capita; countries with high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries. Another economic criterion is industrialization; countries in which the tertiary and quaternary sectors of industry dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating. According to the United Nations Statistics Division,  There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the United Nations system.[5]  And it notes that  The designations "developed" and "developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.[6]  Human Development Index (HDI)[edit] Main articles: Human Development Index and List of countries by Human Development Index The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges a country's level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned "into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development." Since 1990, Norway (2001–2006, 2009–2013), Japan (1990–91 and 1993), Canada (1992 and 1994–2000) and Iceland (2007–2008) have had the highest HDI score. The top 47 countries have scores ranging from 0.793 in Barbados to 0.955 in Norway. Many countries listed by IMF or[Note 1] CIA as "advanced" (as of 2009), possess an HDI over 0.788 (as of 2010). Many countries[Note 2] possessing an HDI of 0.788 and over (as of 2010), are also listed by IMF or CIA as "advanced" (as of 2009). Thus, many "advanced economies" (as of 2009) are characterized by an HDI score of 0.9 or higher (as of 2007). The latest index was released on 24 July 2014 and covers the period up to 2013. The following are the 49 countries in the top quartile - having an HDI above 0.8, and classified as possessing a "Very high human development".   = Increase  = No increase or decrease  = Decrease The number in brackets represents the number of ranks the country has climbed (up or down) relative to the ranking in 2013 report.

The Macanese government calculated the territory's HDI to be 0.868 in 2011. These values place both Taiwan and Macau well within the list of countries with "Very high human development".[9] Furthermore, in 2009 a United Nations project calculated the HDI for all of its members, as well as Taiwan, Macau, and many dependent territories. The HDI values for the countries of San Marino and Monaco, which have not been included in official annual HDI reports, were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively. This places both countries firmly within the category of countries with "Very high human development" as well. The dependent territories with HDI values equivalent to "Very high human development" were: Jersey, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Norfolk Island, Faroe Islands, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, Falkland Islands, Aruba, Puerto Rico, Martinique, and Guam.[10] Of note, the HDI values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old HDI formula, while HDI values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula. Net take-home pay of OECD members[edit] See also: List of countries by net take-home pay While GDP per capita is often used to measure how developed a country is, it includes components that do not contribute to a citizen's standard of living. GDP per capita may increase while real incomes for the majority decline. However, measuring only net take-home pay gives a more accurate picture of a country's standard of living. The tables show net income figures published annually in the OECD Tax Database.[11] They reflect the annual augmented total net take-home pay, by family-type, deducting taxes and non-tax compulsory payments. Since PPP conversion is a widely accepted way to compare income, the OECD publishes the data in USD PPPs. The two major family-types, married with 2 children and single with no child at 100% average wage have been selected to give an accurate picture of the wage levels. Note that Turkey has been omitted from the tables for consistency due to its wage figures being based on the old definition of average worker.

The figures are in international dollars using purchasing power parity and are based on responses from at least 2,000 adults in each country, with the data aggregated from 2006 to 2012.

The three institutions and their lists are the UN list (shown above), the CIA[14] list and the FTSE Group's list, whose list is not included because its association of developed countries with countries with both high incomes and developed markets is not deemed as directly relevant here.[Note 3] However many institutions have created lists which are sometimes referred to when people are discussing developed countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) identifies 37 "advanced economies",[15][16] The OECD, also widely known as the "developed countries club"[17][18][19] has 34 members. The World Bank identifies 74 "high income countries". The EIU's Quality-of-life survey and a list of countries with welfare states are also included here. The criteria for using all these lists and for countries' inclusion on these lists are often not properly spelt out, and several of these lists are based on old data. IMF advanced economies[edit]       Countries described as Advanced Economies by the IMF.    According to the International Monetary Fund the following 37 economies are classified as "advanced economies":[15]    Australia  Austria  Belgium  Canada  Cyprus  Czech Republic  Denmark  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Hong Kong (China)  Iceland  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Japan  Latvia  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Malta  Netherlands  New Zealand  Norway  Portugal  San Marino  Singapore  Slovakia  Slovenia  South Korea  Spain  Sweden   Switzerland  Taiwan  United Kingdom  United States   The CIA has modified an older version of the IMF's list of Advanced Economies, noting that the IMF's Advanced Economies list "would presumably also cover"[14] some smaller countries. These include: See also: The World Factbook list of developed countries    Andorra  Bermuda  Faroe Islands  Guernsey  Holy See  Jersey  Liechtenstein  Monaco   High-income OECD members[edit] There are 31 members in the High-income OECD category, as determined by the World Bank.[20] The High-income OECD membership is as follows: 23 countries in Europe:    Austria  Belgium  Czech Republic  Denmark  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Iceland  Ireland  Italy  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway  Poland  Portugal  Slovakia  Slovenia  Spain  Sweden   Switzerland  United Kingdom   3 countries in Asia:   Israel  Japan  South Korea  3 countries in the Americas:   Canada  Chile  United States  2 countries in Oceania:   Australia  New Zealand  Development Assistance Committee members[edit]     Member nations of the Development Assistance Committee   There are 29 members — 28 selected OECD member countries and the European Union—in the Development Assistance Committee (DAC),[21] a group of the world's major donor countries that discuss issues surrounding development aid and poverty reduction in developing countries.[22] The following OECD member countries are DAC members: 22 countries in Europe:    Austria  Belgium  Czech Republic  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Iceland  Ireland  Italy  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway  Poland  Portugal  Slovakia  Slovenia  Spain  Sweden   Switzerland  United Kingdom   2 countries in Asia:   Japan  South Korea  2 countries in North America:   Canada  United States  2 countries in Oceania:   Australia  New Zealand  Newsweek's "world's best countries"[edit] Newsweek published in 2010 a list of the "world's best countries", measuring "education, health, quality of life, economic dynamism, and political environment" in 100 countries. The top 30 countries are:[23]    Finland   Switzerland  Sweden  Australia  Luxembourg  Norway  Canada  Netherlands  Japan  Denmark  United States  Germany  New Zealand  United Kingdom  South Korea  France  Ireland  Austria  Belgium  Singapore  Spain  Israel  Italy  Slovenia  Czech Republic  Greece  Portugal  Croatia  Poland  Chile   See also[edit]  Developing country Digital divide First World First World privilege First World problem Fourth World Globalization Least developed country Multinational corporation North-South divide Third World  Notes[edit]   ^ The official classification of "advanced economies" is originally made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF list doesn't deal with non-IMF members. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) intends to follow IMF list but adds few economies which aren't dealt with by IMF due to their not being IMF members. By May 2001,the advanced country list of the CIA was more comprehensive than the original IMF list. However, since May 2001, three additional countries (Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia) have been added to the original IMF list, thus leaving the CIA list not updated. ^ Namely sovereign states, i.e., excluding Macau: In 2003 the government of Macau calculated its HDI as being 0.909 (the UN does not calculate Macau's HDI); In January 2007, the People's Daily reported (from China Modernization Report 2007): "In 2004... Macau... had reached the level of developed countries". However, Macau is not recognized by any international organisation as a developed/advanced territory, while the UNCTAD organisation (of the UN), as well as the CIA, classify Macau as a "developing" territory. The World Bank classifies Macau as a high income economy (along with developed economies as well as with few developing economies). ^ The Developed Countries Glossary entry reads: "The following countries are classified by FTSE as developed countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium/Luxembourg, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong (People's Republic of China), Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States."
