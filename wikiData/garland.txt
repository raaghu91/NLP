One method of creating a daisy chain is as follows: daisies are picked and a hole is made towards the base of the stem, generally by piercing with fingernails or tying a knot. The stem of the next flower can be threaded through until stopped by the head of the flower. By repeating this with many daisies, it is possible to build up long chains and to form them into simple bracelets and necklaces.[1] There is another popular method which involves pressing the flower heads against each other, so that the final chain looks like a caterpillar. The term "daisy chain", or "daisy chaining", can also refer to various technical and social "chains".

In poetry[edit] Garlands appear in numerous poems, including La Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats. In the Bible (English Standard Version), Proverbs 4:9 describes Wisdom as: "She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown." In the 1913 novel The Golden Road by Lucy M. Montgomery a "fading garland" is used as a metaphor for the evening of life or aging in general "[...] Did she realize in a flash of prescience that there was no earthly future for our sweet Cecily? Not for her were to be the lengthening shadows or the fading garland. The end was to come while the rainbow still sparkled on her wine of life, ere a single petal had fallen from her rose of joy. [...]".[2] In the 1906 children's book The Railway Children by Edith Nesbit, garland is used as a metaphor as well: "Let the garland of friendship be ever green."[3] In India[edit]     A garlanded image of Devi at the Jain temple of Sravanbelagola       House main door frame decorated with door frame garland (Nila Maalai) during a Housewarming party in Tamil Nadu   In India, where flower garlands have an important and traditional role in every festival, the Gods are decorated with garlands made from different fragrant flowers (often jasmine) and leaves.[4] Both fragrant and non-fragrant flowers and religiously-significant leaves are used to make garlands to worship Hindu deities. Some of those flowers are as follows: jasmine, champaka, lotus, lillies, ashoka, nerium/oleander, chrysanthemum, roses, hibiscus, pinwheel flowers, manoranjini etc. Apart from these, leaves and grasses like arugampul,maruvakam, davanam, maachi, paneer leaves, lavancha are also used for making garlands.

They were not allowed to sell that garland.Each Hindu temple in southern India has nandavanam (floweral garden) where floral plants, trees for garlands are grown. Huge Shiva temples like Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram, Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur and Arunachaleswara Temple, Thiruvannamalai still preserves such Nandavanams for supply of flowers for everyday rituals. Stone Inscriptions of Raja Raja Chola I at Thanjavur gives details of patronage of royals to the conservation of Nadavanams that belongs to The Big Temple.[5] In srirangam ranganathar temple only garlands made by temple sattharars (people who make garlands and never marry - surrendering their life to the lords service) are used to adorn Lord Raganatha.No other garlands, flowers are used there.

The flowers should not be smelled by anyone. They should be plucked only after having bath. The flowers which fell down on earth or dirt should not be used. Namajapam or Repetition of holy names should be done while plucking flowers.
