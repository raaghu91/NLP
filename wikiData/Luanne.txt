(August 2009)     "Luanne"      Single by Foreigner   from the album 4   B-side "Hot-Blooded (live)"   Released August 1982 (1982-08)   Format 7"   Recorded early 1981   Genre Hard rock   Length 3:45 (single)   Label Atlantic   Writer(s) Lou Gramm, Mick Jones   Producer(s) Robert John "Mutt" Lange, Mick Jones   Foreigner singles chronology      "Break It Up" (1982) "Luanne" (1982) "I Want to Know What Love Is" (1984)      "Luanne" was the fifth and final single taken from the album 4 by the band Foreigner, and the second to feature a b-side that was not available on one of their albums, a controversial live version of their hit, "Hot Blooded". The song was written by Lou Gramm & Mick Jones and reached number 75 in the U.S. charts (meager, considering the band's other successful singles) where the album, 4 had already gone to number 1, eventually selling more than six-times platinum, but was a live staple for years to come. The live version of "Hot Blooded" was later placed on the international release of their retrospective, Records, but in subsequent re-releases has been dropped in favour of the original album version due to a couple of choice words spoken in ad lib during the song's performance by its singer, Lou Gramm.         v t e   Foreigner          Mick Jones Thom Gimbel Jeff Pilson Kelly Hansen Michael Bluestein Chris Frazier   Dennis Elliott Lou Gramm Al Greenwood Ian McDonald Ed Gagliardi Rick Wills Johnny Edwards Jeff Jacobs Mark Schulman Bruce Turgon Ron Wikso Brian Tichy Denny Carmassi Jason Bonham Chaz West Paul Mirkovich Bryan Head Jason Sutter         Studio albums    Foreigner Double Vision Head Games 4 Agent Provocateur Inside Information Unusual Heat Mr. Moonlight Can't Slow Down         Compilations    Records The Very Best... and Beyond Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology Complete Greatest Hits Hot Blooded and Other Hits The Essentials The Definitive Collection No End in Sight: The Very Best of Foreigner         Live albums    Classic Hits Live/Best of Live Extended Versions Can't Slow Down...When It's Live!
