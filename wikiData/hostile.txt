ICD-10 R45.4   MeSH D006791   Hostility is seen as form of emotionally charged angry behavior. In everyday speech it is more commonly used as a synonym for anger and aggression. It appears in several psychological theories. For instance it is a facet of neuroticism in the NEO PI, and forms part of personal construct psychology, developed by George Kelly. Kelly's Model[edit] In psychological terms, Kelly considered hostility as the attempt to extort validating evidence to confirm types of social prediction, constructs, that have failed. .[citation needed] Instead of reconstruing their constructs to meet disconfirmations with better predictions, the hostile person attempts to force or coerce the world to fit their view, even if this is a forlorn hope, and even if it entails emotional expenditure and/or harm to self or others. In this sense hostility is a form of psychological extortion - an attempt to force reality to produce the desired feedback, even by acting out in bullying by individuals and groups in various social contexts, in order that preconceptions become ever more widely validated. In this sense, hostility is an alternative response to cognitive dissonance .[citation needed] While challenging reality can be a useful part of life, and persistence in the face of failure can be a valuable trait (for instance in invention or discovery[citation needed]), in the case of hostility it is argued that evidence is not being accurately assessed when the decision is made to repeat the same approach .[citation needed] Instead it is claimed that hostility shows evidence of suppression or denial, and is "deleted" from awareness - unfavorable evidence which might suggest that a prior belief is flawed is to various degrees ignored and willfully avoided[citation needed] See also[edit]  Antisocial personality disorder Righteous indignation  References[edit]          v t e   Emotions (list)       Emotions    Adoration Affection Agitation Agony Awe Amusement Anger Anguish Annoyance Anxiety Apathy Arousal Attraction Caring Compassion Contempt Contentment Defeat Depression Desire Disappointment Disgust Ecstasy Embarrassment Empathy Enthrallment Enthusiasm Envy Euphoria Excitement Fear Frustration Grief Guilt Happiness Hatred Homesickness Hope Horror Hostility Humiliation Hysteria Infatuation Insecurity Insult Interest Irritation Isolation Jealousy Loneliness Longing Love Lust Melancholy Mono no aware Neglect Nostalgia Panic Passion Pity Pleasure Pride Rage Regret Rejection Remorse Resentment Sadness Saudade Schadenfreude Sentimentality Shame Shock Sorrow Spite Suffering Surprise Sympathy Tenseness Wonder Worry            World views    Nihilism Optimism Pessimism Reclusion Weltschmerz                 v t e   Symptoms and signs: cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour (R40–R46, 780.0–780.5, 781.1)       Cognition     Alteration of consciousness    Confusion (Delirium) Somnolence Obtundation Stupor Unconsciousness  Syncope Coma Persistent vegetative state           Fainting/Syncope    Carotid sinus syncope Heat syncope Vasovagal episode         Other    Amnesia  Anterograde amnesia Retrograde amnesia   Dizziness  Vertigo Presyncope/Lightheadedness Disequilibrium   Convulsion            Emotional state    Anxiety Irritability Hostility Suicidal ideation         Behavior    Verbosity         Perception/ sensation disorder    Audition   Olfaction : Anosmia Hyposmia Dysosmia Parosmia Phantosmia Hyperosmia   Tactile perception   Taste: Ageusia Hypogeusia Dysgeusia Parageusia Hypergeusia   Visual perception   Hallucination: Auditory hallucination               v t e   Index of psychology and psychiatry       Description    Mental processes         Disorders    Mental and behavioral  ADHD OCD Tourette's   Mood Developmental  pervasive dyslexia and specific   Substance-related  alcohol   Emotional and behavioral Symptoms and signs  eponymous   Evaluation and testing         Treatment    Psychotherapy  CBT   Drugs  depression antipsychotics anxiety dementia hypnotics and sedatives psychostimulants, ADHD and nootropics             v t e   Index of smell       Description    Anatomy Receptors         Disease    Symptoms and signs         Treatment    –           v t e   Index of taste       Description    Anatomy Physiology         Disease    Symptoms and signs         Treatment    –
