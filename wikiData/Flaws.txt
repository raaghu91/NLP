The album was produced in part by Neil MacColl, guitarist MacColl's father. The rest of the album's production was completed by the vocalist Jack Steadman in his bedroom.[5] In an interview with the Daily Record on 6 February 2010, the band revealed that they had completed recording the album, with MacColl confirming "[it's] hopefully going to come out in May or June".[6] The album was completed in entirely acoustic music. Tracks include reworked versions of some of the band's previous releases, alongside original tracks and cover versions of songs by other artists.[7] The track "Dust on the Ground" was previously recorded on the band's first album, I Had the Blues.., and was released as the album's lead single on 29 June 2009.[8] "Jewel" had also been previously released, as a B-side to the 2010 single "Evening/Morning".[9] "Fairytale Lullaby" is a cover of a song by the late John Martyn (then titled "Fairy Tale Lullaby"), from his first album London Conversation.[10] "Swansea", the final track on the album, is a reworked version of the Joanna Newsom track of the same name.[5] Promotion and release[edit]     Bombay Bicycle Club performing acoustically during the NME Awards Tour, 9 February 2010.   On 2 June 2009, the band supported Starsailor at the Union Chapel in London, performing an acoustic concert in aid of the homelessness charity Crisis.[11] During the set, the band aired acoustic versions of "Flaws" and "Ivy & Gold".[12] Later in the same month, the band embarked on the "Tour For Lulu" throughout June and July 2009, performing four dates in the United Kingdom at locations chosen by fans. The tour was possible because the band had a number of days off in between recording.[13] One location on the tour was a beach hut in Hengistbury Head, with the band including a cover version of Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart".[14] The album was confirmed for release on 12 July 2010 in the United Kingdom, on CD and vinyl.[15] Flaws was preceded by a 7-inch vinyl of "Ivy & Gold" and title track "Flaws", released on 5 July 2010.[16][17] Zane Lowe named "Ivy & Gold" his "Hottest Record in the World" on 12 May 2010,[18] an acclaim given to "Jewel"[9] and ..Blues.. single "Magnet"[19] previously. "Ivy & Gold" was also A-listed in the BBC Radio 1 playlist.[20] As well as this, the band announced a seven date tour of the United Kingdom, with most performances taking place in churches. All dates were performed acoustically.[21] The band also confirmed through Twitter that a video was to be recorded for each track, with "Flaws",[22] "Ivy & Gold",[23] "Swansea"[24] and "Dust on the Ground"[25] in circulation before the album's release. A deluxe version of the album, released through the online retailer Play.com, includes a DVD containing the videos.[26] Reception[edit]   Professional ratings   Review scores   Source Rating   Allmusic [27]   BBC Music (favourable)[28]   Drowned In Sound (6/10)[29]   The Guardian [30]   NME (8/10)[31]   Pitchfork Media (4.0/10)[32]   PopMatters [33]   Flaws received a mixed reception from critics.
