The latter is highly sought because of his works with Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, and also collaborated in her 2000 studio album Mi Destino.[5] Sales and impact[edit]   Professional ratings   Review scores   Source Rating   Allmusic [6]   En El Show [7]   El Nuevo Herald [8]   At the time of its release, Indispensable has received generally mixed reviews from critics; for example critic John Witzgall from Allmusic.com states that "the tracks start off with an intro of highly processed sounds, which are actually sort of appealing. The mixing is also pretty stellar", however he felt that her "production style is simply boring, rather than outright laughable". The songs Esta Vez la Primera Soy Yo, Eres Todo and Ahora Estoy Sin Tí were labeled an "AMG Track Pick". Michael Quaid, En El Show from Mexico, compares her to Dulce María, and he thinks the album is very synthesized and robotic for her voice, and "dangerously juvenile" for a consolidated singer like her, where "she must put her vocal talents in the hands of great composers and leave this kind of rhythms to disposable bushleague artists". The critic Manuel Diaz from El Nuevo Herald stated that "Indispensable is a dizzying musical album with gripping lyrics", where he highlighted that the album is "too young, too disco" for her audience. At the day of its release, this album was placed on the top of the charts of the best sellers, after the success in sales, Siente Music decided to release a Special Edition of the album on January 25, 2011.
