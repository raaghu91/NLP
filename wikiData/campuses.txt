For other uses, see Campus (disambiguation).     Joseph Jacques Ramée's original plan for Union College in Schenectady, New York, the first comprehensively planned campus in the United States[1]   A campus is traditionally the land on which a college or university and related institutional buildings are situated. A modern campus is a collection of buildings that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic. Usually a campus includes libraries, lecture halls, residence halls, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings.

A school might have one space called a campus, one called a field, and another called a yard. History[edit] The tradition of a campus did not start in America, but with the medieval European universities where the students and teachers lived and worked together in a cloistered environment.[3] It was the notion of the importance of the setting to academic life that migrated to America, and early colonial educational institutions were based on the Scottish and English collegiate system.[3] Uses[edit] The meaning expanded to include the whole institutional property during the 20th century, with the old meaning persisting into the 1950s in some places. Office buildings[edit] Sometimes the lands on which company office buildings sit, along with the buildings, are called campuses. The Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Washington is a good example. Hospitals, and even airports sometimes use the term to describe the territory of their facilities. Universities[edit] The word "campus" has also been applied to European universities, although most such institutions are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in urban settings rather than park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.
