It was introduced in 1960 as Pepsi's answer to 7 Up and Coca-Cola's Sprite.[1] Background[edit] Teem was sold in the United States and Canada until 1984, when Lemon-Lime Slice was introduced, though it was still available at some soda fountains into the 1990s. Sierra Mist has since taken over the Teem role in the US. Teem remains on sale today in Brazil, Uruguay, Honduras, South Africa and Pakistan; it survived into the 1990s in other markets too, before Pepsi authorized vendors to replace it with 7 Up.[citation needed] References[edit]   ^ "Managing Imitation Strategies - Steven P.
