This article is about the beverage.  For other uses, see Cola (disambiguation).  Cola   A glass of cola served with ice cubes and lemon slices    Type Soft Drink   Country of origin United States   Introduced 1886   Color Caramel   Flavor Kola nut   Cola is a beverage that may be carbonated and originally contained caffeine from the kola nut and cocaine from coca leaves, and was flavored with vanilla and other ingredients. Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste and no longer contain cocaine. It became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886.[1] His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the Coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863.[1] It usually contains caramel color, caffeine and sweeteners such as sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

Trace flavorings may include nutmeg and a wide variety of ingredients, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Coca-Cola's recipe and several others[which?] are maintained as corporate trade secrets. A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.[4] In addition, stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used; "sugar-free" or "diet" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only. Consumers may prefer the taste of soda manufactured with sugar; as in the United States, with imported Mexican Coca-Cola.[5][6] Kosher for Passover Coca-Cola sold in the U.S. around the Jewish holiday also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is also highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste.[7] In addition, PepsiCo has recently been marketing versions of its Pepsi and Mountain Dew sodas that are sweetened with sugar instead of HFCS. These are marketed under the name Throwback and became "permanent" products on the lineup.[8] Clear cola[edit] Clear cola is a colorless variety of cola produced in the early 1990s. Brands included Crystal Pepsi, Tab Clear and 7 Up Ice Cola. Health[edit] For more details on this topic, see Coca-Cola § Health effects. A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.[9] Studies indicate "soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet",[10] so most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium, magnesium, ascorbic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin A.[11] The drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine, which can cause physical dependence (caffeine addiction).[12] A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in older women (but not men).[13] This was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric acid, and the risk was found to be same for caffeinated and noncaffeinated colas, as well as the same for diet and sugared colas. Many soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup, rather than sugar. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.[14] Regional brands[edit] See also: Cola brands (shown below) and Category:Cola brands Asia[edit]  MyCola, sold in Malaysia by Arqam[15] Amrat Cola, popular in Pakistan.
