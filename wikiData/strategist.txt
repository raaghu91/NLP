Strategist as a personality type[edit] Strategists are known to have an INTJ personality trait, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was derived from Psychiatrist Carl Jung theory of psychological types enabling us to have a better understanding of people’s personality traits and what their strengths are as a person. It is commonly found that Strategists are more prone to possess a combination of 4 specific personality traits, which includes Introversion, iNtuition, Thinking and Judgment forming the acronym INTJ. However, this combination of personality traits is known to be very rare amongst people, making strategist to be very sought after especially by major firms.[7] It is possible at times to find that the vision or ideas of a strategist may not be align with conventional ideas which can make it difficult for others to accept or envision.[8] Career paths[edit] People who possess a strategist mindset are generally capable of doing well in any possible field due to the various traits that they own. Strategist tends to follow a career path, which challenges them mentally in terms of development and seeks to work with people who are in the same caliber in terms of intelligence and competency.

It is said that, Sun-Tzu managed to convince the King of that era that he knew how to train soldiers and proceeded to demonstrate his ability in military strategy by training the King’s concubines. The reason for Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” being so famous is partly due to the reason of Asia becoming an economic power house, by understanding the concepts given, businessmen from the West are able to have a better understanding of the way businesses are managed in countries such as China, Japan and Korea.[11] Furthermore, Sun Tzu’s work is comparably shorter and uses less jargon as compared to the works of other strategist such as Clausewitz.[11] Karl Von Clausewitz[edit] Carl Von Clausewitz (1780-1831)[12] was a Prussian military theorist and strategist who was known for his originality in terms of ideas, influenced mainly by the Napoleonic war.[12] Clausewitz most famous work was called “On War,” however it was not finished and was published posthumously.[13] It is also said that the work of Clausewitz resonates the works of Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War”.[13] Clausewitz Winston Churchill[edit]     Sir Winston S Churchill   Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965)[14] was the prime minister of the United Kingdom and was in office from 1940 to 1945 and 1951 to 1955.[15] Churchill was known for his leadership role during World War II.[16] However, there were many controversial incidents, which resulted in Churchill’s reputation as a strategist to waver between being known as a savior and a scapegoat.[17] The battle of Gallipoli, which started on April 25, 1915[18] was one of the major setbacks in Churchill’s military career, having pressed on the battle of Gallipoli resulted in the casualty of over 200,000[19] allied soldiers. Napoleon Bonaparte[edit] Napoleon Bonaparte (August 15, 1769 – May 5, 1821) was a military general who later established the French empire in 1804[20] becoming empower as well. Napoleon was known to be the pioneer during the French revolution. Bonaparte was in charge of leading the French army to victory during the Battle of Marengo fought on the 14th of June 1800.[21] His strategic thinking and plans allowed the French to win despite having less in numbers and resources.
