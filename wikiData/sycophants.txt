    Botticelli's illustration of Dante's Inferno shows insincere flatterers grovelling in excrement in the second pit of the eighth circle.[1]   Sycophancy[2] is flattery that is very obedient, or an indication of deference to another, to an excessive or servile degree. A user of sycophancy is referred to as a sycophant. Alternative phrases are often used such as:   apple-polishing ass kissing ass licking bootlicker brown nosing crawler fawning flunky grovelling hanger-on kowtowing lickspittle sucking up toady yes man   See also[edit]   Codependency Narcissistic supply Henchman Lackey Minion Sidekick   References[edit]   ^ Italian culture 15, American Association of University Professors of Italian, 1997, p. 80  ^ Alphons Silbermann, translator Ladislaus Loeb (2000), Grovelling and other vices: the sociology of sycophancy, Continuum International Publishing Group, ISBN 978-0-485-11544-4    Further reading[edit]  Clark, L.
