Navigation[edit] By convention, the bottom side of a map is south, although reversed maps exist that defy this convention.[1] To go south using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 180°. Alternatively, in the Northern Hemisphere the Sun will be roughly in the south at midday.[2] South Pole[edit] True south is the direction towards the southern end of the axis about which the earth rotates, called the South Pole. The South Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south geographic pole.[3] Roald Amundsen from Norway was the first to reach the south pole, on 14 December 1911, after Ernest Shackleton from the UK was forced to turn back some distance short.[4] Geography[edit] The Global South refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system.[5] In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports."[5] Use of the term 'South' may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide - for example the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States by the Mason–Dixon line, or the South of England, which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the North of England. Other uses[edit] In the card game bridge, one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against East and West.[6] References[edit]   ^ "The Upsidedown Map Page". flourish.org. Retrieved 2 December 2013.  ^ "How to use a compass". Learn Orienteering.
