The band comprises Joel Pearce on vocals/guitars, Joe Newcombe on guitars/vocals, Dean Bowden on bass/vocals and Adam Cann on drums. In describing their music, Cann has said "We’ve fallen into progressive rock – soundscapy too I think.”[1] Flights cite their primary influences as Oceansize, Radiohead, Reuben and Yourcodenameis:milo.[1] Flights have also described their style as "Some big guitars, some pretty guitars, irregular time signatures, harmonised vocals and a whole lotta groove."[2]    Contents   1 History  1.1 Formation 1.2 2010 - 2011 (first EP) 1.3 2012 - Current   2 Discography 3 References 4 External links    History[edit] Formation[edit] Joe Newcombe, Adam Cann and Joel Pearce come from Thornbury, a market town in South Gloucestershire approximately 12 miles (19 km) north of Bristol. From age 13, Newcombe and Cann had played together in various bands (Cradle Of Fluff, Alcoholic Spider). They met Pearce (then a member of Enigma Design) while playing in pubs in the Thornbury region. When Newcombe went to university he met Dean Bowden and subsequently Newcombe, Bowden and Cann went on to play together in a band called Just For Hustlers. Deciding they wanted to try something different, they then recruited Pearce (who had discussed starting a band with Cann during Friday drinking sessions) and thus completed the Flights line-up.[1] Flights played their first gig in a small Bristol venue called The Louisiana debuting the tracks "Charity Calendars" and "The Mapmaker" among others.[1] 2010 - 2011 (first EP)[edit] For the majority of 2010 Flights divided their time between touring and writing sessions.[3] In September 2010 Flights recorded their debut EP Flights at Outhouse Studios in Reading. The six tracks comprising Flights were engineered, produced and mixed by James Billinge assisted by Tom Hollister.
