The first version of the song was recorded by the American country music group Lonestar, whose version was released in March 1999 as the second single from their 1999 album Lonely Grill. Lonestar's version is their longest-lasting Number One single and biggest hit, spending eight weeks at the top of the Billboard country chart. A remix later reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts as well. Since the release of the original, the song has been covered by Bonnie Tyler, Duncan James, and Fady Maalouf, all of whom have released their respective versions as singles. Ben Mills, Boyz II Men and Shane Filan have included covers in their respective albums. On The Sing-Off (season 4, episode 3), judge Shawn Stockman, of Boyz II Men fame, mentioned that the song had been offered to them first, and they decided to turn it down. "Amazed" was the last country-classified song to hit Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 until the week of September 1, 2012, when "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" by Taylor Swift climbed from No. 72 to No. 1.

The song spent eight consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart that same year. With this accomplishment, it set a record for the longest run at Number One on the country chart since Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems was initiated in 1990. This run was later tied by Alan Jackson's and Jimmy Buffett's 2003 single "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere", which spent eight non-consecutive weeks at Number One. "Amazed" spent 41 weeks on the country singles chart,[3] giving it the second-longest chart run of any country single in the 1990s.[4] In addition, the single crossed over into the pop airwaves entering the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 81. It peaked at No. 24 on before falling off the Hot 100. It had sold 900,000 copies in the US as of April 2011.[5] "Amazed" was then remixed for pop radio (a tactic commonly used to present country-leaning songs to mainstream audiences) and the new mix's popularity prompted the single to re-enter the Hot 100 at No. 45. On this second chart run, it hit No. 1 on March 4. In doing so, it became the first country song to top the pop charts since Dolly Parton's and Kenny Rogers' 1983 duet "Islands in the Stream".[6] It also made Lonestar the first country band to place a song in the Top Ten of the Hot 100 year-end countdown. All remixes of the song made the single spend a combined total of 55 weeks in the Hot 100, and 41 weeks on Hot Country Singles & Tracks. In the United Kingdom, Lonestar's version of "Amazed" reached a peak of No. 21 and spent 22 weeks in the charts. It spent 17 weeks in the top 40 without ever breaking into the top 20. Music video[edit] Trey Fanjoy directed the music video for Lonestar's rendition. It was released in July 1999. It alternates between shots of the band performing the song in a dark room, and a model making seductive poses. The model is portrayed by Sunny Mabrey.
