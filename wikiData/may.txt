May is a month of Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and spring in the Northern Hemisphere (Summer in Europe). Therefore May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. No other month begins or ends on the same day of the week as May in any year. This month is the only month to have these two properties. However, May like all other months does share starting and ending days with various months of both previous and following years: every year, May starts and ends on the same day of the week as January of the following year. Additionally, in years immediately before common years, May starts and ends on the same day of the week as October of the following year; it also ends on the same day of the week as February of the following year. In years immediately before leap years, May starts on the same day of the week as April of the following year; it also both starts and ends on the same day of the week as July of the following year. In a common year, May both starts and ends on the same day of the week as August of the previous year; it also ends on the same day of the week as November of the previous year. In a leap year, May both starts and ends on the same day of the week as March of the previous year; it also starts on the same day of the week as November and ends on the same day of the week as June, both of the previous year. In a leap and a year immediately after that, May starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year. Late May typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the United States and Canada and ends on Labor Day, first Monday of September.
