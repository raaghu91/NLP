(June 2014)       The knee of a patient is examined with the help of radiography after an injury.   Injury is damage to a biological organism caused by physical means.[1] Major trauma is injury that can potentially lead to serious outcomes. In 2013 4.8 million people died from injuries up from 4.3 million in 1990. More than 30% of these deaths were transport related injuries. In 2013 367,000 children less than five died from injuries down from 766,000 in 1990.[2]    Contents   1 Classification  1.1 By ultimate cause 1.2 By modality 1.3 By location 1.4 By activity   2 See also 3 References    Classification[edit] The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by  nature, part of body affected, source and secondary source, and event or exposure.  The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since.[3] The World Health Organization developed the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by  mechanism of injury, objects/substances producing injury, place of occurrence, activity when injured, the role of human intent,  and additional modules. The classification is designed to allow researchers to study the cause of injuries and injury prevention.[4] The Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries.[5] By ultimate cause[edit]  Intentional injury  Suicide and self-harm Violence and war   Accidents  Stingray injury Lightning injuries    By modality[edit]  Traumatic injury, a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical collision or movement[6]  Avulsion injury Blast injury Internal bleeding Crush injury Needlestick injury Catastrophic injury   Repetitive strain injury or other strain injury Other injuries from external physical causes, such as radiation poisoning, burn, or frostbite  Radiation-induced lung injury Microwave burn   Injury from toxin or as adverse effect of a pharmaceutical drug (e.g., vaccine injury)  Toxic injury   Injury from internal causes such as reperfusion injury  By location[edit]  Wound, an injury in which skin is torn, cut or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.
