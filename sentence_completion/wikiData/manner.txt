(September 2014)       Manner Logo       The Manner Factory in Hernals, Vienna   Manner is a line of confectionery from the Austrian conglomerate, Josef Manner & Comp AG. The corporation, founded in 1890, produces a wide assortment of confectionery products. These include wafers, long-life confectionery, chocolate-based confectionery, sweets, cocoa and a variety of seasonal products. The company's best-known product are the "Neapolitan wafers", introduced in 1898. They are sold in blocks of ten 47 x 17 x 17 mm hazelnut-cream filled wafers. The hazelnuts were originally imported from the Naples region in Italy, hence the name. The basic recipe has remained unchanged to this day. The company logo is a picture of St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. This dates to the 1890s, when Josef Manner opened his first shop next to the Cathedral. The Archdiocese of Vienna and the Manner Company agreed that the company may use the cathedral in its logo in return for funding the wages of one stonemason performing repair work on the structure.[1]    Contents   1 Popular culture 2 References 3 See also 4 External links    Popular culture[edit] The Manner wafer products had a cameo appearance in the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, when the Terminator, played by Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger, grabs a bunch when shopping for food at the gas station in the desert. Since Manner wafers are one of Schwarzenegger's favorite snacks, he integrated them into the movie. Manner ran a series of television commercials in Austria in 2003, marketing their wafer with the release of the movie in theatres. Manner wafers could also be seen on the glass counter in the Central Perk café during season six of the TV sitcom Friends. Manner was also a sponsor of Mexican skier Hubertus Von Hohenlohe, the oldest athlete competing in the 2010 Winter Olympics.
