Located on the Ramganga, it is the capital of Bareilly division and the geographical region of Rohilkhand. The city is 252 kilometres (157 mi) north of the state capital, Lucknow, and 250 kilometres (155 mi) east of the national capital, New Delhi. Bareilly is the fourth city in Uttar Pradesh with compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations (after Lucknow, Kanpur and Agra). It is the seventh-largest metropolis in Uttar Pradesh and the 50th-largest in India. The city, also known as Nath nagari (Land of Lord Shiva), Zari nagari and historically as Sanjashya (where the Buddha descended from Tushita to earth),[1] is a centre for furniture manufacturing and trade in cotton, cereal and sugar. Its status grew with its inclusion on the "counter magnets" list of the National Capital Region (NCR), a list also including Hissar, Patiala, Kota and Gwalior.[2] The city is also known as Bans-Bareilly. Although Bareilly is a production centre for cane (bans) furniture, "Bans Bareilly" is not derived from the bans market; it was named for two princes: Bansaldev and Baraldev, sons of Jagat Singh Katehriya, who founded the city in 1537.[3] Bareilly's 2011 population was 898,167.[4]    Contents   1 History  1.1 Founding  1.2 Ali Muhammad Khan 1.3 British East India Company 1.4 Modern period  1.4.1 Rebellion of 1857    1.5 Independence    2 Geography 3 Climate  3.1 Environment   4 Demographics 5 Culture  5.1 Entertainment and performing arts 5.2 Cuisine 5.3 Sports 5.4 Recreation 5.5 Musical references    6 Politics 7 Economy 8 Public sector undertakings   8.1 Agriculture 8.2 Electricity 8.3 Fuel   9 Transport   9.1 Roads   9.1.1 Improvements    9.2 Rail  9.3 Air   10 Education 11 Health care  11.1 Traditional 11.2 Western    12 Defence installations 13 Hindu temples 14 Gurudwara's 15 Places Of Islamic Interests 16 Churches 17 See also 18 References 19 External links    History[edit] Main article: History of Bareilly In the 12th century, the kingdom was under the rule by different clans of Kshatriya Rajputs. With the Islamic Turkic Invasion the region became a part of the Delhi Sultanate before getting absorbed in the emerging Mughal Empire. The foundation of the modern City of Bareilly foundation was laid by Mukrand Rai in 1657. Later the region became the capital of Rohilkhand region before getting handed over to Nawab Vazir of Awadh and then to East India Company (transferred to the British India) and later becoming an integral part of India. The region has, also, acted as a mint for a major part of its history. From archaeological point of view the district of Bareilly is very rich. The extensive remains of Ahichhatra, the Capital town of Northern Panchala have been discovered near Ramnagar village of Aonla Tehsil in the district. It was during the first excavations at Ahichhatra (1940–44) that the painted grey ware, associated with the advent of the Aryans in the Ganges–Yamuna Valley, was recognised for the first time in the earliest levels of the site. Nearly five thousand coins belonging to periods earlier than that of Guptas have been yielded from Ahichhatra. It has also been one of the richest sites in India from the point of view of the total yield of terracotta. Some of the masterpieces of Indian terracotta art are from Ahichhatra. In fact the classification made of the terracotta human figurines from Ahichhatra on grounds of style and to some extent stratigraphy became a model for determining the stratigraphy of subsequent excavations at other sites in the Ganges Valley. On the basis of the existing material, the archaeology of the region helps us to get an idea of the cultural sequence from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 11th century AD. Some ancient mounds in the district have also been discovered by the Deptt. of Ancient History and culture, Rohilkhand University, at Tihar-Khera (Fatehganj West), Pachaumi, Rahtuia, Kadarganj and Sainthal.[5] Founding [edit] Bareilly was founded in 1537 by Basdeo, a Katehriya Rajput. The city was first mentioned by the historian Budayuni, who wrote that Husain Quli Khan was appointed the governor of "Bareilly and Sambhal" in 1568. The divisions and revenue of the district "being fixed by Todar Mal" were recorded by Abul Fazl in 1596. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mukrand Rai in 1657. In 1658, Bareilly became the headquarters of the province of Budaun.[6] The Mughal policy of encouraging Afghan settlements to control the Katehriyas succeeded if the central government was strong. After Aurangzeb's death, the Afghans (who had become local potentates) began to seize and occupy neighbouring villages.     Regions of Uttar Pradesh, including Rohilkhand (capital Bareilly)   In 1623 two Afghan brothers from the Barech tribe (Shah Alam and Husain Khan) settled in the region, bringing other Pashtun settlers. With the immigration of Daud Khan, an Afghan slave originally from Roh, Afghanistan, the Afghan Rohillas rose to prominence. His adopted son, Ali Muhammad Khan, established his headquarters in the region and was named governor of Kateher by Aurangzeb; the region was known as "the land of the Ruhelas".[citation needed] After the fall of the Mughal Empire, many Pathans migrated from Rohilkhand. Bareilly (like other cities in Uttar Pradesh) experienced economic stagnation and poverty, leading to the migration of Rohilla Muslim Pathans to Suriname and Guyana as indentured labour.[7][8] Ali Muhammad Khan[edit] Ali Muhammad Khan (1737–1749), grandson of Mohd.Razi, captured the city of Bareilly and made it his capital; he later united the Rohillas in the State of Rohilkhand from 1707 to 1720. He rose to power, and was confirmed to own the lands he had seized. The emperor made him a nawab in 1737 and governor of Rohilkhand in 1740.     Hafiz Rahmat Khan, to the right of Ahmad Shah Durrani (on a brown horse), during the Third battle of Panipat) on 14 January 1761   Ali Muhammad was succeeded by Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech (1749–1774), whom he appointed regent of Rohilkhand on his deathbed. Barech extended the power of Rohilkhand from Almora in the north to Etawah in the southwest. Under him Rohilla power continued to grow, although the area was torn by strife among rival chieftains and struggles with neighbouring powers (particularly the Nawab Vazirs of Awadh, the Bangash Nawabs and the Marathas). British East India Company[edit] Under Barech at the 1761 Third Battle of Panipat, Rohilkhand blocked the expansion of the Maratha Empire into northern India. In 1772 it was invaded by the Marathas, repulsing the invasion with the aid of the Nawab of Awadh. After the war, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula demanded payment for the nawabs' help from Barech. When his demand was refused, the nawab joined the British (under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion) to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Daula and the Company defeated Barech (who was killed in battle at Miranpur Katra, ending Rohilla rule) in 1774. Rohilkhand was handed over to Daula, and from 1774 to 1800 the province was ruled by the Nawab of Awadh. By 1801, subsidies due under the treaties to support a British force had fallen into arrears. To pay the debt, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan surrendered Rohilkhand to the East India Company in a treaty signed on 10 November 1801. [9] During the reign of Shah Alam II, Bareilly was the headquarters of Rohilla Sardar Hafiz Rehmat Khan and many coins were minted. The city was later in the possession of Awadh Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, and his coins had Bareilly, Bareilly Aasfabad and the Bareilly kite and fish as identification marks. Coins were then minted by the East India Company.[10] Modern period[edit]     A 1912 map of northern India, showing the principal centres of the 1857–1859 rebellion: Meerut, Delhi, Bareilly, (Kanpur), Lucknow, Jhansi and Gwalior   After the Rohilla War, the change in the power structure increased discontent throughout the district. Increased taxation from 1812[11] to 1814 increased resentment of the British: "Business stood still, shops were shut and multitudes assembled near the courthouse to petition for the abolition of the tax." The Magistrate Dembleton, already unpopular, ordered the assessment to be made by a Kotwal. A skirmish between rebels and the sepoys (under Captain Cunningham) cost 300–400 lives. In 1818, Glyn[who?] was posted as Acting Judge and Magistrate of Bareilly and the Joint Magistrate of Bulundshahr. Glyn asked Ghulam Yahya to write an account of "craftsmen, the names of tools of manufacture and production and their dress and manners". The most popular trades in and around Bareilly during the 1820s were manufacturing glass, jewellery, glass and lac bangles and gold and silver thread, crimping, bean drying, wire drawing, charpoy weaving, keeping a grocer's shop and selling kebabs.[6] Rebellion of 1857 [edit] Bareilly was a centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys), employed by the British East India Company's army, against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities on 10 May 1857 in Meerut. It expanded into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, primarily in the major north-central Indian river valleys; local episodes extended northwest to Peshawar (on the northwest frontier with Afghanistan) and southeast (beyond Delhi). There were riots in many parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor and Moradabad called for the revival of a Muslim kingdom.[12]     Bareilly was made part of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.   The Rohillas actively opposed the British, but were disarmed.[13] Khan Bahadur Khan Rohilla, grandson of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, formed his own government in Bareilly in 1857 and a widespread popular revolt in Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand took place. In 1857, Khan Bhadur Khan issued silver coins from Bareilly as an independent ruler.[14] When the rebellion failed, Bareilly was subjugated. Khan Bahadur Khan was sentenced to death, and hanged in the police station on 24 February 1860. Independence [edit] Bareilly Central Jail housed a number of political prisoners during the British Raj, including Yashpal (who marrieed while imprisoned on 7 August 1936 was the first such ceremony in an Indian jail). The prison rules were changed, preventing future prison marriages.[15] Before independence, Muslims constituted nearly half the population of Bareilly. After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, nearly one-fifth of the Muslim population of the city settled in Pakistan (primarily in Karachi). Hindus and Sikhs migrated from Pakistan, settling in Bareilly.[citation needed] Geography[edit] Bareilly is in northern India, at 28°10′N 78°23′E﻿ / ﻿28.167°N 78.383°E﻿ / 28.167; 78.383.

Rail [edit] See also: Bareilly Railway Station     Indian Railways network in 1909   Bareilly has been connected to the rest of India by rail since the 19th century, and a 1909 map shows that Bareilly was a railway junction during the early 20th century. Six rail lines intersect in the city. In 1890 the Bengal and North Western Railway leased the Tirhoot State Railway to increase the latter's revenue, and the Lucknow-Sitapur-Seramow Provincial State Railway merged with the Bareilly-Pilibheet Provincial State Railway to form the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway on 1 January 1891. The Lucknow-Bareilly Railway was owned by the Government of India, and operated by the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway. The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was formed on 1 January 1943 by the merger of the Bengal and North Western Railway, the Tirhut Railway (BNW operated), the Mashrak-Thawe Extension Railway (BNW operated), the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway and the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway (R&K operated). The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was later renamed the Oudh Tirhut Railway; it merged with the Assam Railway and the Kanpur-Achnera section of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway to form North Eastern Railway (headquartered in Gorakhpur, with a divisional headquarters in Izzat Nagar), one of the 16 zones of the Indian Railways.[27][28][29][30]     Bareilly Junction station   Six railway stations serve the city:  Bareilly Junction (broad and meter gauge) C.B. Ganj Station (broad gauge) Chenheti Station (broad gauge) City Station (broad gauge) Izzatnagar Station (meter and broad gauge) Bhojipura Station (meter and broad gauge)  Bareilly is on the Moradabad-Lucknow route. Trains from the north (including Jammu Tawi and Amritsar) and Delhi running east and northeast (to Gorakhpur, Barauni, Howrah, Guwahati and Dibrugarh) pass through Bareilly, and the city is also on the route from Uttarakhand to Kasganj and Mathura. Many trains to railway stations in Uttarakhand pass through Bareilly. Air[edit] The Indian Air Force has a base at Izzatnagar, on the outskirts of Bareilly. Although it is not open to civilian aviation (except for high government officials), there are plans for a civilian terminal adjacent to the runway.[31] Education[edit]     Bareilly College   Bareilly has a number of universities and research institutes, including M. J. P. Rohilkhand University, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) and the Central Avian Research Institute (CARI)—the latter two in Izzatnagar. The city has engineering colleges (Institute of Engineering and Technology, A Govt Engineering College at M. J. P. Rohilkhand University Campus), management, law, medical and other colleges. Bareilly College, in the heart of the city, was built in 1837 and is among the oldest educational institutions in India.[citation needed] The M. J. P. Rohilkhand University (1975), Bareilly College (1837) and a number of private colleges and universities comprise Bareilly's higher-education system. Established in 1889, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute is dedicated to livestock research. With a faculty of 275, in addition to research the institute offers instruction, consultation and technology transfer at the post-graduate level to students from India and abroad.[32] siddhi vinayak a very popular engineering college is here Health care[edit] Traditional[edit] The city attracts patients from the Kumaun, Rohilkhand and western Nepal regions. During the Vedic period, Bareilly was noted for Ayurvedic treatment. The practitioners of that period promoted the cultivation of Aonla, popularly known as Indian gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica, syn. Emblica officinalis), on the outskirts of Bareilly (leading the area to be named Aonla).[citation needed] Western [edit] During the 1857 mutiny, Bareilly was besieged for almost a year; hundreds of revolutionaries faced summary trials and execution, and were medically examined. A makeshift medical-examination facility was built near the Kotwali area of the city, which grew into the city's major health-care facility. For 50 years the facility grew slowly, addressing the spread of infectious diseases. It later served wounded British officers and sepoys during World War II, with an emergency operating theatre and a portable X-ray machine for white officers and soldiers.[citation needed] Bareilly has two medical colleges, one dental college and one ayurvedic college. Defence installations[edit] In addition to the air-force base, Bareilly is the regimental centre and a major settlement of the Jat Regiment (one of the longest-serving and most-decorated infantry regiments of the Indian Army.[33] The regiment won 19 battle honours from 1839 to 1947,[34] and five battle honours, eight Mahavir Chakra, eight Kirti Chakra, 32 Shaurya Chakras, 39 Vir Chakras and 170 Sena Medals since independence.[33] Bareilly is the regional headquarters of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).and Border Security Forces(BSF) Bareilly.
