It was released on March 22, 2011 on Vagrant Records in the US and Underground Operations in Canada.[1] The word scurrilous is defined as "vulgar verbal abuse; foul-mouthed; coarse, vulgar, abusive, or slanderous."[2] It is the last album released under Protest the Hero's original lineup, due to the departure of drummer Moe Carlson and bassist Arif Mirabdolbaghi two years later.

Walker stated on his Twitter page on that day: "it has begun" [3] and also on his Facebook page on the 31st that "It is underway", both in reference to the band's next full length album recording.[4] During the recording process, Protest the Hero posted three studio updates showcasing bass, drums, guitar and vocals. The band has stated that the album will contain a more "progressive" sound compared to their last two albums. In support of the album, Protest the Hero embarked on a North American tour, with a large number of dates in their native Canada, from March to May 2011. The band released the first single "C'est La Vie" on February 3, 2011.[5] Cover art[edit] The album cover is a picture of a 60-year-old painting by bassist Arif Mirabdolbaghi's grandfather, Jafar Petgar, titled "Scurrilous".[6] The painting was inspired by a disagreement between Petgar and his wife that stemmed from "conjecture and scurrilous lies" being spread by a neighbor. The painting is meant to represent the world fleeing from the lies originating from the human tongue. According to Mirabdolbaghi, the piece was selected by Protest the Hero as the cover art for Scurrilous because they "thought the wide and varied use of color in the piece reflected the contrasting sonic landscapes of the music on the album."[7] Reception[edit]   Professional ratings   Review scores   Source Rating   Allmusic [8]   Decibel [9]   Sputnikmusic [10]   MetalSucks [11]   Critical reception for Scurrilous has generally been positive, with the album receiving four out of five stars from Allmusic, who lauded the band for its shift toward more personal lyrics.[8] Adam Thomas of Sputnikmusic found the album to be "a lot less jarring when compared to their past work, with the transitions between the light speed arpeggio runs, tight modern metal riffing, and mathy stop start sections seamlessly binding it all together."[10] However, Decibel magazine gave the album a five out of ten.[9] Track listing[edit] All music by Protest the Hero   Standard Edition    No. Title Lyrics Length    1.

The phrase coincides with the lyrical content of the song which discusses the futility of suicide.[12] The track title "Dunsel" is a reference to Star Trek, which all members of the band are known to be avid fans of. The term is first used in the episode The Ultimate Computer, where Spock explains that the term is used by midshipmen to describe a position or role that serves no real purpose. This too coincides with the lyrical content of the song.
