For other uses, see Crew (disambiguation) and Crews (disambiguation).     Crew of a spacecraft.   A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization. A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard[citation needed]. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title Crewman. Crew also refers to the sport of rowing, where teams row competitively in racing shells.[1] Crew is used colloquially to refer to a small, tight-knit group of friends or associates engaged in criminal activity[citation needed]. Also used in reference to the traditional "unit" of criminals under the supervision of a caporegime in the American Mafia. However, the term is not specific to (Mafia-affiliated) organized crime. Crew can also refer simply to a group of friends, unrelated to crime or violence. See also[edit]  For a specific sporting usage, see Rowing crew. For filmmaking usage, see Film crew.
