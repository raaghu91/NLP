The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is known as both "the Steel City" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, as well as "the City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[3] The city features 30 skyscrapers, 2 inclines, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the source of the Ohio River at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers. This vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest through the mineral-rich Alleghenies made the area coveted by the French and British Empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, Civil War raiders and media networks.[4] Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led innovations in aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics.[5] This creative wealth placed Pittsburgh behind only New York and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment, second to New York in bank assets and with the most U.S. stockholders per capita for much of the 20th century.[6] America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers after multi-billion-dollar corporate raids relocated the longtime Pittsburgh-based world headquarters of Gulf Oil, Sunbeam, Rockwell and Westinghouse.[7] This status as a global industry center, its melting pot of immigrant workers, and top-10 rank among the largest U.S. cities until 1950 and metro areas until 1980[8] left the area with renowned museums, medical centers,[9] parks, research centers, libraries, a vibrantly diverse cultural district and the most bars per capita in the U.S.[10] These legacies have earned Pittsburgh the title of America's Most Livable City by Places Rated Almanac, Forbes, and The Economist as National Geographic and Today named the city a top world destination. The area has added over 3,000 hotel rooms in the last decade with higher occupancy than 11 comparable cities.[11] Google, Uber, Intel, IBM and Apple are among 1,600 technology firms generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh payrolls, with the area serving as the long-time federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] The area is home to 68 colleges and universities including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[13] The nation's fifth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300 US law firms make their global headquarters in the Pittsburgh area, while RAND, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer and NIOSH have regional bases that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[14] A leader in environmental design the city is home to 60 total and 10 of the world's first green buildings while billions have been invested in the area's Marcellus fields.[15] A renaissance of Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry—that boasts the world's first movie theater—has grown from the long-running Three Rivers Film Festival to an influx of major productions including Disney and Paramount offices with the largest sound stage outside Los Angeles and New York City.[16]    Contents   1 History 2 Geography  2.1 Cityscape  2.1.1 Areas  2.1.1.1 Golden Triangle 2.1.1.2 North Side 2.1.1.3 South Side 2.1.1.4 East End 2.1.1.5 West End   2.1.2 Ethnicities 2.1.3 Population densities 2.1.4 Images   2.2 Regional identity 2.3 Climate  2.3.1 Air and water quality     3 Demographics 4 Economy 5 Arts and culture  5.1 Entertainment 5.2 Theatre 5.3 Literature 5.4 Local dialect 5.5 Livability   6 Sports  6.1 Baseball 6.2 Football 6.3 Ice hockey 6.4 Basketball 6.5 Golf 6.6 Annual sports events   7 Government and politics  7.1 Government 7.2 Politics 7.3 Law enforcement 7.4 Crime   8 Education 9 Media 10 Utilities 11 Health care  11.1 Health discoveries 11.2 Notable patients   12 Transportation  12.1 Rail 12.2 Port 12.3 Expressways and highways 12.4 Airports 12.5 Public transit   13 Notable people 14 Sister cities 15 See also 16 Notes 17 References 18 Further reading 19 External links    History[edit] Main articles: History of Pittsburgh, Etymology of Pittsburgh and Timeline of Pittsburgh     The Fort Pitt Blockhouse, dating to 1764, is the oldest extant structure in the City of Pittsburgh.    Historical Claims   French Empire 1669–1758 British Empire 1681–1781 United States 1776–present     Pittsburgh was named in 1758 by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. Forbes was a Scotsman and it is conjectured that the pronunciation was originally intended to be /ˈpɪtsbᵊrə/ PITS-brə or PITS-bə-rə (similar to Edinburgh).[17] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771 and as a borough on April 22, 1794 with the following Act:[18] "Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be...erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[19] Pittsburgh is one of the few American cities to be spelled with an h at the end of a burg suffix.[20] From 1890 to 1911 the city's "h" was removed but after a public campaign it was officially restored by the United States Board on Geographic Names.[19] The area of the Ohio headwaters was inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of native Americans.[21] The first European was the French explorer/trader Robert de La Salle in his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River from Quebec.[22] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European traders established area posts and settlements.[23] In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched a serious expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[23] Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw. During 1753–54, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[24] The British and colonial force met defeat at Braddock's Field and it was not until General John Forbes's 1758 march that the French surrendered the forks. Forbes began construction on Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State and soon-to-be Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[25] Pontiac's Rebellion had native tribes lead a siege of Fort Pitt for two months until Colonel Henry Bouquet's victory at the Battle of Bushy Run. The battle's outcome was also the first use of biological warfare. Lord Jeffrey Amherst ordered blankets inoculated with smallpox distributed to the tribes surrounding the fort in 1763. Unlike the Europeans, the Native Americans had no acquired immunity, and as smallpox spread into other areas and infected other tribes, it killed between 400,000–500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans.[26][27] The 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix allowed the Penns to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey of the land situated between the two rivers referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[28] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region until 1780 when it was agreed to extend the Mason-Dixon Line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771 Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created with Pitt Township.[29][30] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[31] Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. The Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 saw unrest and federal troops. By 1797, glass began to be manufactured in the city, while the population grew to around 1,400. American settlement began either via routes over the Appalachian Mountains or through the waterways of the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Midwest.     Monongahela River scene, 1857       Downtown facade memorializing Pittsburgh's industrial heritage with an image of legendary steelworker Joe Magarac   The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46 year old local government became a city. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains, before the Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt and by 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. In 1901, Carnegie merged several companies into U.S. Steel. By 1911, Pittsburgh was the nation's 8th largest city, accounting for between a third and a half of national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a half million with European immigration via Ellis Island. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[32] Pittsburgh was a main destination of the African-American Great Migration,[33] with 95% percent becoming unskilled steel workers.[34] World War II saw area mills operate 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel,[25] but also recorded the highest levels of air pollution in its almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[35][36] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[37] Following the war, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance." This much-acclaimed effort was followed by the "Renaissance II" project in 1977 and focusing on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded, with massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[7]     President Barack Obama visiting Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Center in 2011   In the latter 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a decrease in city population. During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them, and one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh MSA experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States as 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values.[38] Pittsburgh's story of economic regeneration was the inspiration for President Barack Obama to host the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit.[39] Geography[edit] See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity Pittsburgh has a total area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) (or 4.75%) is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau,[40] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River from the northeast and Monongahela River from the southeast form the Ohio River. The actual convergence is in Point State Park and referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.     Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mt. Washington   Many of the city's neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods make reference to "hills," "heights," or other similar indicators by name.[a] The city has some 712 sets of outdoor pedestrian stairs with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet including hundreds of paper streets composed entirely of stairs and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[41] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[42] Bike and walking trails border many of the city's rivers and hollows, but steep hills and variable weather can make biking a challenge. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 245 miles (394 km) away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape[edit] Areas[edit] See also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks     Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods   The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[43] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are further subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (in total, Pittsburgh contains 90 neighborhoods).[44] These areas, relative to downtown, are known as the North Side, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. Golden Triangle[edit]     Downtown Pittsburgh from Station Square   Downtown Pittsburgh is compact, featuring 30 skyscrapers, 9 of which top 500 feet (150 m). U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[45] The Cultural District comprises a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. It is packed with theaters and arts venues, and is seeing a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on Riverparc, a four-block mixed-use "green" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and is home to the distinctive PPG Place Gothic glass skyscraper complex. This area is seeing a growing residential sector, as new condo towers are constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use. Downtown is serviced by the Port Authority's subway and multiple bridges leading north and south.[46] It is also home to Point Park University, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University which borders Uptown. North Side[edit] Further information: North Side (Pittsburgh)     The North Side   The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh. Allegheny City merged with Pittsburgh under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to many popular attractions such as Heinz Field, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory installation art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Highmark SportsWorks, Penn Brewery and Allegheny Observatory. The North Side is also home to Allegheny General Hospital, which is listed among the 1999 US News & World Report 2000 best hospitals nationwide. South Side[edit] Further information: South Side (Pittsburgh) The South Side was once composed primarily of dense inexpensive housing for mill workers, but has in recent years become a local Pittsburgher destination. The South Side is one of the most popular neighborhoods in which to own a home in Pittsburgh. The value of homes in the South Side has increased in value by about 10% annually[citation needed] for the past 10 years. The South Side's East Carson Street is one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, pulsing nightlife and live music venues. In 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property, and worked together with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development including a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers indoor practice fields. Construction began in 1998, and the SouthSide Works is now open for business with many store, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.[47] East End[edit]     The Shadyside neighborhood       The Carnegie Library, Museums of Art and Natural History (foreground), Carnegie Mellon University (background)   The East End is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Frick Art & Historical Center (Clayton and the Frick art museum), Phipps Conservatory, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods featuring large shopping/business districts. Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, Schenley Park and the Petersen Events Center. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers, which is expected to benefit from the recent new construction of a new Children's Hospital. The Strip District is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. West End[edit] Further information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the Downtown skyline and numerous other residential neighborhoods like Sheraden and Elliott. Ethnicities[edit] Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history. These include:  German: Troy Hill, Mt. Washington, and East Allegheny (Deutschtown) Italian: Brookline, Bloomfield, Morningside, Oakland and Beechview Polish and other Central European: South Side, Lawrenceville, and Polish Hill African American: Hill District, Homewood, and Larimer Jewish: Squirrel Hill  Population densities[edit] Several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less urban, featuring tree-lined streets, yards and garages giving a more characteristic suburban feel, while other aforementioned neighborhoods, such as Oakland, the South Side, the North Side, and the Golden Triangle are characterized by a more diverse, urban feel. Images[edit]      Pittsburgh seen from Mt. Washington. The Monongahela River in the foreground.         Same as above, different time of day.    Regional identity[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies, but the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area extends into both the Southern United States (West Virginia) and the Midwestern United States (Ohio) with the borders of the three regions meeting only 30 miles (48 km) from the city. Pittsburgh is also in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, a collection of primarily Midwestern cities, reflecting Pittsburgh's socio-economic connections to Ohio and points west.[48][49] Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia".[50] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[51][52][53][54] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, as well as its status as Appalachia's largest city. Climate[edit] Pittsburgh lies in the humid continental climate zone as it transitions to the humid subtropical climate (Köppen Dfa/Cfa).[55] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas lie in zone 6a.[56] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold, cloudy, and moderately snowy, springs and falls generally mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers warm to hot and humid; as measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[57] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 72.6 °F (22.6 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[58] a considerable heat index arises. Pittsburgh averages 112 days of at or below freezing temperatures, and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[58] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[58][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[58] Average annual precipitation is 38.2 inches (970 mm) and total precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.41 in (1,458 mm) in 2004.[59] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 41.4 inches (105 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 82.0 in (208 cm) in 1950–51.[60] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[61] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (43%).[62]    Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh International Airport), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1871–present[c]   Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year   Record high °F (°C) 75 (24) 77 (25) 84 (29) 90 (32) 95 (35) 98 (37) 103 (39) 103 (39) 102 (39) 91 (33) 82 (28) 74 (23) 103 (39)   Average high °F (°C) 35.7 (2.1) 39.3 (4.1) 49.2 (9.6) 61.7 (16.5) 70.8 (21.6) 79.1 (26.2) 82.5 (28.1) 81.4 (27.4) 74.3 (23.5) 62.6 (17) 51.2 (10.7) 39.4 (4.1) 60.6 (15.9)   Average low °F (°C) 21.1 (−6.1) 23.0 (−5) 30.0 (−1.1) 40.2 (4.6) 49.3 (9.6) 58.4 (14.7) 62.8 (17.1) 61.5 (16.4) 54.0 (12.2) 42.9 (6.1) 34.7 (1.5) 25.3 (−3.7) 41.9 (5.5)   Record low °F (°C) −22 (−30) −20 (−29) −5 (−21) 11 (−12) 26 (−3) 34 (1) 42 (6) 39 (4) 31 (−1) 16 (−9) −1 (−18) −12 (−24) −22 (−30)   Average precipitation inches (mm) 2.70 (68.6) 2.39 (60.7) 2.95 (74.9) 3.11 (79) 3.95 (100.3) 4.30 (109.2) 3.83 (97.3) 3.48 (88.4) 3.11 (79) 2.29 (58.2) 3.23 (82) 2.85 (72.4) 38.19 (970)   Average snowfall inches (cm) 11.5 (29.2) 10.2 (25.9) 7.4 (18.8) 1.5 (3.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0.4 (1) 2.1 (5.3) 8.3 (21.1) 41.4 (105.2)   Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 16.2 13.6 14.0 13.8 13.3 12.1 10.2 9.8 9.8 10.5 12.8 15.1 151.2   Avg. snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 11.4 8.3 5.9 2.0 0 0 0 0 0 0.3 3.0 8.5 39.4   Average relative humidity (%) 69.9 67.3 64.1 59.8 63.4 66.2 68.8 71.2 72.0 68.3 70.2 71.9 67.8   Mean monthly sunshine hours 93.9 108.5 155.4 182.8 217.4 242.2 254.9 228.4 196.7 167.3 99.4 74.4 2,021.3   Percent possible sunshine 31 36 42 46 49 54 56 54 53 48 33 26 45   Source: NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961–1990)[58][63][57]   Air and water quality[edit]    "It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county...We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more."  “ ”  Guillermo Cole  In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association (ALA) ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th amongst other U.S. metro areas.[64][65] Although the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions used for the survey.[66] The region's readings also reflect pollution from Ohio and West Virginia, though both are outside the jurisdictional powers of local leadership.[67] Although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009 and just 10 between 2008 and 2010 compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[68] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated that "It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county...We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more."[69] The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits, however, fish catches in the city in 2007 were found to be more than twice as free of pollutants than catches on the Canadian side of Lake Erie and six times as free of pollutants than Allegheny River catches of the New York border area.[70] Despite these positive results, there are concerns about local storm sewers and waste treatment plants frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. The city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's total tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the "urban forest" contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000/year on street tree planting and maintenance.[71] Demographics[edit]   Historical population   Year Pop. ±%   1760* 149 —       1761* 332 +122.8%   1796* 1,395 +320.2%   1800 1,565 +12.2%   1810 4,768 +204.7%   1820 7,248 +52.0%   1830 12,568 +73.4%   1840 21,115 +68.0%   1850 46,601 +120.7%   1860 49,221 +5.6%   1870 86,076 +74.9%   1880 156,389 +81.7%   1890 238,617 +52.6%   1900 321,616 +34.8%   1910 533,905 +66.0%   1920 588,343 +10.2%   1930 669,817 +13.8%   1940 671,659 +0.3%   1950 676,806 +0.8%   1960 604,332 −10.7%   1970 520,117 −13.9%   1980 423,938 −18.5%   1990 369,879 −12.8%   2000 334,563 −9.5%   2010 305,704 −8.6%   Est. 2013 305,841 +0.0%   U.S. Decennial Census[72] 2013 Estimate[73]   At the 2010 Census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000. 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other and 2.3% mixed. 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino origin of any race.

The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education and services. Total annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[88] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[89] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[90] or the American Dream.[91] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been directly renovated into modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[92] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[93] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".[94] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[95]    Pittsburgh is the poster child for managing industrial transition.  “ ”  Dr. Robert Mauro  The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees.

Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[116] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists. There are also specific Pittsburgh genres that have been adopted in globally, from children's television to sci-fi/fantasy to Yinzer Pittsburghese. Pittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Happy's Party, Cappelli & Company and The Children's Corner, all nationally broadcast. The Pittsburgh Dad series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011. The modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his Chiller Theatre,[117] director and writer Rusty Cundieff[118] and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[119] The genre continues today with the PARSEC writers organization,[120] The It's Alive Show, the annual "Zombie Fest",[121] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[122] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[123] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[124][125] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose. Local dialect[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh English The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called Pittsburghese, was influenced by Scots-Irish, Welsh, German, Central European and Eastern European immigrants. Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as "Yinzers" (from the local word "yinz" [var. yunz], a blended form of "you ones," similar to "y'all" and "you all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy (slippery), redd up (clean up), jagger bush (thorn bush) and gum bands (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be." In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed," "needs washing," or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted the New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as, "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect."[126] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[127] Livability[edit]     Pittsburgh from the West End Overlook   Pittsburgh often places high in lists of the nation's most livable cities. After placing fourth and first in the first two editions of Places Rated Almanac, Pittsburgh finished third in 1989, fifth in 1993, 14th in 1997 and 12th in 2000, before reclaiming the number one spot in 2007.[128] The survey's primary author, David Savageau, has noted that Pittsburgh is the only city to finish in the top 20 of every edition. In 2005, 2009 and 2011, Pittsburgh was named most livable city in the United States and in those years, between the 26th and 29th most livable city worldwide by The Economist.[129][130] Pittsburgh ranked No. 28 in the book Cities Ranked and Rated (2004) by Bert Sperling and Peter Sander. In 2010, Forbes and Yahoo! listed Pittsburgh as the most livable city in the United States.[131][132] A month later, Forbes named Pittsburgh the 7th best place to raise a family.[133] Pittsburgh was ranked the 4th best city for working mothers by Forbes in 2010[134] and the city was ranked as one of the best for entrepreneurs by Entrepreneur.[135] Forbes named Pittsburgh, in an 8-way tie, the world's 10th cleanest city for 2007.[136] The Economist Intelligence Unit named Pittsburgh the top place to live in the United States in 2011,[137] and behind only Honolulu for 2012.[138] The city was listed among the 10 best U.S. places to retire in 2012 by CBS Money Watch and U.S. News.[139][140] In February 2013 Forbes again placed Pittsburgh among its 10 most unexpectedly romantic world locations.[141] In April 2014, Niche rated Pittsburgh the 15th best city for millennials.[142] Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, crime, and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living compared to other northeastern U.S. cities. According to the Federal Housing Board the average price for a 3- to 4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh for 2004 is $162,000, well below the national average of $264,540. Average 2010 rent for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh was $789. This compares to the nationwide average of $1,087.[143] Enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is that the area faces little natural disaster risk such as an earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. Forbes ranked Pittsburgh as having the 2nd lowest natural disaster risk in the nation for 2009.[144] Greater Pittsburgh is not entirely free of natural disasters, however. Residents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams experience occasional floods,[145] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[146] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[145][147][148] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding, and the cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[145] Pittsburgh has the most bars per capita in the nation.[10] Sports[edit] Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh boasts several professional teams which have won the city the Sporting News title of "Best Sports City" in the United States in 2009[149] and Sperling's Best Places "top 15 cities for baseball" in 2013.[150] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne. Nearby Penn State and West Virginia University have sizable fanbases in the city. Pittsburgh's dedication to sports has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball[151]—share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold. This tradition of solidarity is unique to Pittsburgh. The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[152] "Rails to Trails", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail. Several mountain biking trails are located within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[citation needed]   Pro Club Founded League Sport Venue Championships   Pittsburgh Pirates 1882 MLB Baseball PNC Park 1901* 1902* 1909 1925 1960 1971 1979   Pittsburgh Steelers 1933 NFL American football Heinz Field 1974 1975 1978 1979 2005 2008   Pittsburgh Penguins 1967 NHL Ice hockey Consol Energy Center 1991 1992 2009   Steel City Yellow Jackets 2014 ABA Basketball CCAC Allegheny Arena 1968**   Pittsburgh Riverhounds 1999 USL Pro Soccer Highmark Stadium    Pittsburgh Passion 2002 IWFL American football 2007   Pittsburgh Force 2008 WFA American football Rubenstein Stadium    *1901 and 1902 were Pre World-Series Era Champions. **Pittsburgh's ABA franchise won the 1968 title, however the current franchise are heirs to it only in location.

The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park, annually ranked as one of the sports best venues with ESPN.com stating: "[t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball…The best stadium in baseball is in Pittsburgh."[153] PNC Park hosted the team's MLB record-tying fifth All-Star game in 2006. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro League history with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup in 1971. One sportswriter claimed, "No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh."[154] The Pirates set the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons with 20 from 1993 until 2012 between their 3 straight National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each) and their 2013 National League Division Series and 2014 Wild Card appearances—despite a September pennant race in 1997 that featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[155] Football[edit] For more details on this topic, see American football in Western Pennsylvania.     Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Panthers (football)       Heinz Field seen from above   Football is the most popular and tradition laden sport in the region with the nation's first professional game being played in the city on November 12, 1892, between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, the first pro-team in nearby Latrobe and first organized league, the NFL and their inaugural champions: the Pittsburgh Stars. High school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive press coverage. The Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves and ESPN's Bound for Glory with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to capture the tradition and passion high school football enjoys in the region. College football in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and recently qualifying for seven straight bowl games for 31 total. Pittsburgh is the closest major city/media market to both Penn State and West Virginia. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University and Washington & Jefferson College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs. The city's most popular team is the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are more than a sports team to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises on and off the field. The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[156] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the most NFL playoff berths (27) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most NFL conference championship games. Heinz Field serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s repsectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two total.[157] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s. Ice hockey[edit]     Consol Energy Center, home of the Pittsburgh Penguins   Ice hockey in Pittsburgh has become increasingly popular on both the amateur and professional levels during the last few decades and has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The world's first artificial ice rink debuted at the city's Schenley Gardens in 1898 and was later improved at the Duquesne Gardens. The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with a future Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons; all in an "original six" NHL era with "farm team" talent (especially Calder Cup champions) exceeding the level on most modern day NHL playoff teams. The NHL's first expansion in 1967 included the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team has won four Eastern Conference titles and three Stanley Cup championships in 30 playoff seasons. Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the Consol Energy Center in 2010 the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance "The Igloo". Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center, and like 100 years ago, Pittsburgh is again a hotbed for semi-pro and amateur teams such as the top 50 ranked Junior Penguins, Predators and Viper Stars with the Hornets a top 20 team for the last 7 years. Pro-grade ice rinks such as the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe have trained several native Pittsburgh players for NHL play. RMU hosted the city's first Frozen Four college championship in 2013 with the four Consol Energy Center games televised by ESPN. Basketball[edit] Professional basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams "Monticello" and "Loendi" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937–45 in the NBL), the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947–48 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens (1961–63), the Pittsburgh Condors (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968 and playing until 1972), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004–08) and Phantoms (2009–10) both of the ABA. The city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season "neutral site" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[158]     Petersen Events Center, home of Pittsburgh Panthers basketball       Palumbo Center, home of Duquesne Dukes basketball   The Dukes of Duquesne University and the Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh have played College basketball in the city since 1914 and 1905 respectively. During the 1940s to the 1970s, Duquesne was the city's first team to appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP Poll ranking (1954),[159] and to win a post-season national title, the 1955 National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne became the world's first and still only college program to produce back-to-back NBA #1 overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green. Duquesne's Chuck Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team.[160] The Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a "national title game" against LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13 conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 25 times including a post season tournament every season since 1999–2000 and regularly sells out the Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All Americans while ranking #1 in the nation as recently as 2009. Since the 1970s, the suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA Division I basketball qualifying for the NCAA Tournament in each of the last four decades (8 total) and have played in post-season tournaments 6 of the last 7 seasons including the 2013 National Invitation Tournament upset win over the defending national champions Kentucky Wildcats. All three programs schedule out-of-conference games with each other most seasons while Pitt and Duquesne have played the annual City Game since 1932. Pittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game in 1965. The Roundball Classic annually featured future NBA hall of famers at the Civc Arena with Nike and Asics as sponsors and ESPN televising. The Civic Arena also hosted the Championship Tournament for the Eastern Eight Conference from 1978 until 1982. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. Golf[edit] Golf has deep roots in the area. The oldest U.S. course in continuous use, Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887 calls the region home. Suburban Oakmont Country Club holds the record for most times as host for the U.S. Open (8). U.S. Women's Open (2), PGA Championships (3), and U.S. Amateurs (8) have also called Oakmont home. See also: List of people from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Golf Golf legends Arnold Palmer, Jim Furyk and Rocco Mediate learned the game and began their careers on Pittsburgh area courses. Suburban courses such as Laurel Valley Golf Club and the Fox Chapel Golf Club have hosted PGA Championships (1937, 1965), the Ryder Cup (1975), LPGA Championships (1957–58), Senior Players Championships (2012–14) and the Senior PGA Championship (2005). Local courses have sponsored annual major tournaments for 40 years:   Pennsylvania Open Championship 1920–1940 (even years) Dapper Dan Open 1939–1949 Pittsburgh Open (LPGA Tour) 1956 Pittsburgh Senior Classic 1993–1998 84 Lumber Classic 2001–2006 Mylan Classic 2010–2013   Annual sports events[edit]     Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix   Pittsburgh also hosts several annual major sporting events, including the:  Three Rivers Regatta (Since 1977) Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix (Since 1983) Dirty Dozen Cycle Race (Since 1983) Pittsburgh Marathon (Since 1985) Great Race 10K (Since 1985) Head of the Ohio Regatta (Since 1987)  The city's vibrant rivers have attracted annual world title competitions of the Forrest Wood Cup in 2009 and the Bassmaster Classic in 2005.

The mayor and the nine-member council serve a four-year term. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief of Staff has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning and as a "gatekeeper" to the mayor. City council members are chosen by plurality elections in each of nine districts. The government's official offices are located in the Pittsburgh City-County Building. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court holds sessions in Pittsburgh, as well as Harrisburg and Philadelphia.

Daniel Lavelle, Deborah Gross, Dan Gilman, and Rev. Ricky Burgess.[161] The president of city council is Bruce Kraus. Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist and was selected as the birthplace of the national Republican Party, when the party held its first convention in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold until the Great Depression combined with entrenched local GOP scandals swept in the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's current ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[162] Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Jim Ferlo-district 38, Wayne D. Fontana-42, and Jay Costa-43) and nine House Districts (Jake Wheatley-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Dom Costa-21, Erin Molchany-22, Dan Frankel-23, Ed Gainey-24, Dan Deasy-27, Paul Costa-34, and Harry Readshaw-36).

More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[164][165] Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):    Murder Rape Robbery Assault Burglary Theft Motor Vehicle Total Violent Total Property   City 13.1 15.1 363.3 360.4 812.8 2,438.2 174.3 752.0 3,425.4   Education[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh     University of Pittsburgh       Carnegie Mellon University   Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[188] UPMC announced in 2013 that it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[189] Health discoveries[edit] Many notable physicians have made major world discoveries and innovations at area hospitals including polio vaccine developer Jonas Salk, MRI inventor Paul Lauterbur, pediatric psychoanalyst Benjamin Spock, CPR and intensive care unit pioneer Peter Safar, surgeon Thomas Starzl who perfected organ transplantation, pathologist Maud Menten who made enzyme kinetics discoveries, orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine expert Freddie Fu, pioneering immunologist Niels Kaj Jerne, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, Vitamin C's discoverer Charles Glen King, pediatrician Jack Paradise, head and neck cancer surgeon/otolaryngologist Eugene Nicholas Myers, laparoscopic liver resection pioneer David Geller, virologists Patrick S. Moore and Yuan Chang, who co-discovered Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and breast cancer treatment pioneer Bernard Fisher. UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver & heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989),[190] the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[191] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009) and the first total forearm & hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[192][193]     Children's Hospital   The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9 year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[194] Notable patients[edit] Several notable patients have chosen to be treated at the city's hospitals including President Yudhoyono (2012), Steelers founder Art Rooney (1988),[195][196] MCI Communications founder William G. McGowan (who in 1990 gifted $1 million ($1.9 million today) to UPMC),[197] a Saudi princess (1983),[198] Rob Buck (2000),[199] Bob Prince (1985),[200] William Block, publisher of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (2005),[201] PGA golfer David Toms (2005),[202] ESPN broadcaster Stuart Scott (2007),[203] 2 1/2 old Lauren Toohey for a liver transplant (1981),[204] Miami 7 year old Ronnie DeSillers for a liver transplant (1987),[205] 9 year old Tabatha Foster for an innovative transplant surgery that had President Ronald Reagan commending the city's hospitals & urging donations to Tabatha's recovery in 1988.[206] In 1997, a Tennessee judge denied James Earl Ray's request for a UPMC liver transplant.[207] Both Governors Tom Corbett (2011) and Robert P. Casey (1993), months before his presidential bid were treated at AGH and UPMC respectively. Transportation[edit]     At least fifteen of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo   Main article: Transportation in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With a total of 446,[208] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges."[209] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Heinz Field and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries the Port Authority's Blue/Red/Brown subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[210] Rail[edit]     Penn Station was built in 1903   Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard—originally built in 1889—was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Amtrak provides intercity rail service via the Capitol Limited and the Pennsylvanian which use Penn Station. Port[edit] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[211] Expressways and highways[edit]   Expressways Other Highways    Parkway North  US 19  PA 88      Parkway East & West   Truck US 19  PA 121    Crosstown  PA 8  PA 130    Route 28  PA 50  PA 380    Route 65  PA 51  PA 837        PA 60  PA 885       I-279   Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the CONSOL Energy Center. The 45 mile long and 70 mile long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport and Arnold Palmer Regional Airport provide commercial passenger service to the metropolitan area. Public transit[edit]     The Steel Plaza subway station   Port Authority of Allegheny County, commonly known as the Port Authority, but sometimes referred to by its former nickname "PAT" or "PAT Transit", is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area (the nation's 20th largest metro area), it is the 11th largest transit agency in the nation and helped the region rank 8th on commuters that use non-car means to work, 2nd to only Chicago in metros outside the Northeast corridor.[212] Port Authority runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[213] The Duquesne Incline is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[214] but accepts Port Authority passes and charges Port Authority fares. Since 2007, the Port Authority cut annual expenses by $52 million and raised revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a $472 million gap in the state transportation budget.[215][216] Notable people[edit] Main article: List of people from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area Sister cities[edit] Pittsburgh has 20 sister cities:[217]    Bilbao, Spain  Da Nang, Vietnam  Donetsk, Ukraine  Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay  Gaziantep, Turkey  Karmiel, Israel  Matanzas, Cuba  Misgav, Israel  Naucalpan, Mexico  Omiya, Japan  Ostrava, Czech Republic  Prešov, Slovakia  Saarbrücken, Germany  Saitama (Omiya-ku, formerly Omiya city), Japan  San Isidro, Nicaragua  Sheffield, United Kingdom  Skopje, Macedonia  Sofia, Bulgaria  Wuhan, China  Zagreb, Croatia   See also[edit]      Book: Pittsburgh      Best places in the US to retire Pittsburgh (disambiguation) Pittsburgh metropolitan area Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Allegheny, Pennsylvania List of municipalities in Pennsylvania List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh          Pittsburgh portal Pennsylvania portal Geography portal North America portal United States portal         Notes[edit]   ^ The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill. ^ The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010 and July 16, 1980.[58] ^ Records kept January 1871 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the warm minima temperature records set at WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.
