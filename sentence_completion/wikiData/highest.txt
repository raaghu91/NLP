In terms of the point farthest away from the centre of the Earth, Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,267 m (20,561 ft)) can be considered the planet's most extreme high point. This is due to the Earth's oblate spheroid shape, with points near the Equator being farther out from the centre than those at the poles. B.^ All temperatures from the World Meteorological Organization unless noted. C.^ The former record of 57.7 °C (135.9 °F) recorded at Al 'Aziziyah, Libya on 13 September 1922 was ruled no longer valid by the WMO due to mistakes made in the recording process.[17] E.^ Temperatures greater than 50 °C (122 °F) in Spain and Portugal were recorded in 1881, but the standard with which they were measured and the accuracy of the thermometers used are unknown; therefore, they are not considered official. Unconfirmed reports also indicate that a set of Spanish stations may have hit 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) during the 2003 heat wave.[18] F.^ A temperature of −66.1 °C (−87.0 °F) was recorded at North Ice, Greenland on 9 January 1954. However due to unknown recording conditions it is not considered official.[19] G.^ A temperature of 53.1 °C (127.6 °F) was recorded in Cloncurry, Queensland on 16 January 1889 under non-standard exposure conditions and is therefore not considered official.[20] H.^ A temperature of −25.6 °C (−14.1 °F) is reported for Ranfurly, New Zealand having occurred on 18 July 1903. However, it is not listed by the WMO.[21]      Coldest and hottest inhabited places on Earth[edit]   Hottest inhabited place Dallol, Ethiopia, whose annual mean temperature was recorded from 1960 to 1966 as 34.4 °C (93.9 °F).[22] The average daily maximum temperature during the same period was 41.1 °C (106.0 °F).[23]   Coldest inhabited place Oymyakon (Russian: Оймякон), a village (selo) in Oymyakonsky Ulus of the Sakha Republic, the Russian Federation, located along the Indigirka River.[24] It has the coldest monthly mean with −50 °C (−58 °F) the average temperature in January, the coldest month.[25] Eureka, Nunavut, Canada has the lowest annual mean temperature at −19.7 °C (−3.5 °F).[26]   The South Pole and some other places in Antarctica are colder and are populated year-round, but almost everyone stays less than a year and could be considered visitors, not inhabitants.   Extreme ground temperatures[edit] Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 °C.[27] A ground temperature of 84 °C (183.2 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan, Sudan.[28] A ground temperature of 93.9 °C (201 °F) was recorded in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California, USA on 15 July 1972; this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded.[29] The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 °C for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.[30] Satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009.) These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.[27] Satellite measurements of the surface temperature of Antarctica, taken between 1982 and 2013, found a coldest temperature of −93.2 °C (−136 °F) on 10 August 2010, at 81°48′S 59°18′E﻿ / ﻿81.8°S 59.3°E﻿ / -81.8; 59.3. Although this is not comparable to an air temperature, it is believed that the air temperature at this location would have been lower than the official record lowest air temperature of −89.2 °C.[31][32] Greatest vertical drop[edit]   Greatest purely vertical drop   1,250 m (4,101 ft) Mount Thor, Auyuittuq National Park, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada (summit elevation 1,675 m (5,495 ft))[33][34]   Greatest nearly vertical drop   1,340 m (4,396 ft) Trango Towers, Pakistan (summit elevation 6,286 m (20,623 ft))   Subterranean[edit] Further information: Mining § Records   Deepest mine 4,000 m (13,123 ft) Mponeng Gold mine, South Africa   Deepest mine under sea level 2,733 m (8,967 ft) under sea level Kidd Mine, Ontario, Canada   Deepest open-pit mine 1,200 m (3,937 ft) Bingham Canyon Mine, Utah, USA   Deepest open-pit mine under sea level 293 m (961 ft) under sea level Tagebau Hambach, Germany   Deepest cave 2,193 m (7,195 ft) Voronya Cave, Arabika Massif, Georgia   Deepest pitch (single vertical drop) 603 m (1,978 ft) Vrtoglavica Cave, Slovenia   Greatest oceanic depths[edit]   Atlantic Ocean 8,648 m (28,373 ft) Milwaukee Deep, Puerto Rico Trench   Arctic Ocean 5,450 m (17,881 ft) Litke Deep, Eurasian Basin   Indian Ocean 7,258 m (23,812 ft) Java Trench[35]   Pacific Ocean 10,971 m (35,994 ft) Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench[36]   Southern Ocean 7,235 m (23,737 ft) South Sandwich Trench (southernmost portion, at 60°S)   Deepest ice[edit] Ice sheets on land, but having the base below sea level.
