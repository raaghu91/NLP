Their first and only live single, it was released at the end of 1980. All tracks from the single were recorded by ATV, for inclusion in a television documentary, and most of this concert found its way onto the album Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! that month, including "Danced". The two B-sides from the single, however, were left off the album and for years were only available here. They were later included on the 2005 compilation album The Safari Singles Collection Part 1: 1979-1981, and on the 2006 re-issue of Toyah! Toyah! Toyah!.
