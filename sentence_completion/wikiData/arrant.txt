Originally meaning wandering, the term came to be an intensifier due to its use as an epithet, e.g. in the phrases "arrant thieves" and "arrant knaves" (i.e., wandering bandits).[1] Pronunciation[edit]  (UK) IPA(key): /ˈæɹənt/  Adjective[edit] arrant (comparative arranter, superlative arrantest)  Utter; complete.  arrant nonsense! [1708][2]   Alternative spelling of errant  circa 1600, William Shakespeare, Hamlet, scene 1:  We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us.      Usage notes[edit] Particularly used in the phrase “arrant knaves”, quoting Hamlet, and “arrant nonsense”.[3] Some dictionaries consider arrant simply an alternative form of errant, but in usage they have long since split. The word has long been considered archaic, may be confused with errant, and is used primarily in clichés, on which basis some recommend against using it.
