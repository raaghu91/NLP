It forms the Tina Mayor estuary, the natural border between Asturias and Cantabria.     The road by the house is the starting point for the "Ruta del Cares":    The Cares is known because of the narrow and spectacular canyon it forms when passing the Picos de Europa. A trekking path, "Ruta del Cares", runs along the river. The stream is also known for the quality of its salmon. The Cares river is joined by de Deva river. Many companies rent kayaks to descend both rivers. Kayaking is popular here during the summer.
