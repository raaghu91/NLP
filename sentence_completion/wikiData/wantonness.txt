For other uses, see Incontinence (disambiguation). Incontinence ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term Akrasia (ἀκρασία). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire'[1] incontinence may also be called wantonness.

Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment.[3] Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think.[4] At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because not a product of moral choice but of a failure to act on one's better knowledge.[5] Later developments[edit] For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of will: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently chose lesser over greater goods.[6] In the structural division of Dante's Inferno, incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles.[7] The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins,[8] even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell. Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's The Faerie Queene, representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger;[9] and as late as Jane Austen the sensibility of such figures as Marianne Dashwood would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.[10] With the triumph of Romanticism, however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture.[11] Blake wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained".[12] Encouraged by Rousseau, there was a rise of what Arnold J. Toynbee would describe as "an abandon (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which antinomianism is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".[13] A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama.[14] Partly in reaction, the proponents of emotional intelligence would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and delayed gratification[15] – to his dictum that "a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control".[16] See also[edit]  Seven deadly sins  References[edit]   ^ dictionary.com – incontinence ^ J.
