AllMusic reviewer Kurt Morris stated that "Sawyer keeps the beats tight and Tucker is always brimming over with passion and the kind of power of which many bands in the hardcore scene aren't even capable. Not so much in an overtly masculine manner, but through intelligently refined viciousness transmitted via the appropriate musical spectrum".[2] Similarly, prominent music critic Robert Christgau highlighted Tucker's noisy guitar playing as well as Sawyer's controlled drumming.[3] Track listing[edit] All music composed by Heavens to Betsy.
