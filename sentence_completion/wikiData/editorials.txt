(April 2013)       Editorial from a 1921 issue of Photoplay recommending that readers not see the film Heedless Moths, which featured nude scenes.   An editorial, leading article (UK) or leader (UK), is an opinion piece written by the senior editorial staff or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document. Editorials may be supposed to reflect the opinion of the periodical.[citation needed] In Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times[1] and The Boston Globe,[2] editorials are often classified under the heading "opinion". Illustrated editorials may appear be in the form of editorial cartoons.[3] Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion.[4] Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English language press, this is done rarely and only on topics considered especially important; however, it is more common in some European countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.[5] In the field of fashion publishing, the term has been adapted to refer to photo-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as a photo-essay) without accompanying text.[6] See also[edit]  Column (periodical)  References[edit]   ^ Staff (23 May 2012).
