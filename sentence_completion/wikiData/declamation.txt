A declamation or declamatio (Latin for "declaration") is the rhetorical device of adopting the persona of an ancient figure to express a particular viewpoint or perspective. A typical example is Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 5th-century author who was long thought to be a figure named in the Book of Acts. Some early Christians, later classified as Gnostics, used this technique in the construction of various gospels attributed to them.
