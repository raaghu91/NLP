(February 2008)   In astrology, a celestial body is said to be in detriment, or exile, when it is positioned in the zodiac sign opposite the sign it rules (over which it has domicile). When a celestial body is in detriment it is said to be not comfortable in that sign and to tend to operate with the least strength.[1] The sign detriments are as follows:   Body Domicile Detriment   Sun Leo Aquarius   Moon Cancer Capricorn   Mercury Gemini Virgo Sagittarius Pisces   Ceres Virgo Pisces   Venus Taurus Libra Scorpio Aries   Terra Taurus Scorpio   Mars Aries Scorpio Libra Taurus   Jupiter Sagittarius Pisces Gemini Virgo   Saturn Capricorn Aquarius Cancer Leo   Uranus* Aquarius Leo   Neptune* Pisces Virgo   Pluto* Scorpio Taurus    Signs of detriment for the non-visible planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are not firmly established or as widely applied as those of the seven classical planets.
