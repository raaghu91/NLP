Revenge is a harmful action against a person or group in response to a grievance, be it real or perceived. It is also called payback, retribution, retaliation or vengeance; it may be characterized as a form of justice (not to be confused with retributive justice), an altruistic action which enforces societal or moral justice aside from the legal system. Francis Bacon described it as a kind of "wild justice" that "does... offend the law [and] putteth the law out of office".[1]    Contents   1 Function in society  1.1 Revenge dynamics   2 History  2.1 Arabia during Muhammad's era   3 Proverbs 4 In the arts 5 See also 6 References    Function in society[edit]     Engraving by Gustave Doré illustrating the Erinyes, chthonic deities of vengeance and death    Shakespeare's Hamlet tells a history in which a man avenged the murder of his father by killing his uncle[2] (Artist: Gustave Moreau)     Detractors argue that revenge is simply wrong, of the same design as "two wrongs make a right". Social psychologist Ian Mckee says the desire for the sustenance of power motivates vengeful behavior as a means of impression management: "People who are more vengeful tend to be those who are motivated by power, by authority and by the desire for status. They don't want to lose face."[3][4] Revenge dynamics[edit] Some societies encourage the revengeful behavior which is called blood feud. These societies usually attribute the honour of individuals and groups a central role. Thus, while protecting of his reputation an avenger feels as if he restores the previous state of dignity and justice. According to Michael Ignatieff, "revenge is a profound moral desire to keep faith with the dead, to honour their memory by taking up their cause where they left off." [5] Thus, honour may become a heritage that passes from generation to generation. Whenever it is compromised, the affected family or community members might feel compelled to retaliate against an offender to restore the initial "balance of honour" that preceded the perceived injury. This cycle of honour might expand by bringing the family members and then the entire community of the new victim into the brand-new cycle of revenge that may pervade generations.[6] History[edit]     German announcement of killing 2300 civilians in Kragujevac massacre as retaliation for 10 killed German soldiers. Nazi-occupied Serbia, 1941   Feuds are cycles of provocation and retaliation, fuelled by a burning desire for revenge and carried out over long periods of time by familial or tribal groups; they were an important part of many pre-industrial societies, especially in the Mediterranean region. They still persist in some areas, notably in Albania with its tradition of gjakmarrja or 'blood feuds.'[7] During the Middle Ages, most would not regard an insult or injury as settled until it was avenged, or, at the least, paid for — hence, the extensive Anglo-Saxon system of wergild (literally, "man-price") payments, which placed a certain monetary value upon certain acts of violence in an attempt to limit the spiral of revenge by codifying the responsibility of a malefactor. Blood feuds are still practised in many parts of the world, including Kurdish regions of Turkey and in Papua New Guinea.[8][9] In Japan's feudal past, the Samurai class upheld the honour of their family, clan, or lord through the practice of revenge killings (敵討ち katakiuchi). These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. Today, katakiuchi is most often pursued by peaceful means, but revenge remains an important part of Japanese culture. The motto of Scotland is Nemo Me Impune Lacessit, Latin for 'Nobody shall provoke/injure me with impunity'. The origin of the motto reflects the feudal clan system of ancient Scotland, particularly the Highlands. The goal of some legal systems is limited to "just" revenge — in the fashion of the contrapasso punishments awaiting those consigned to Dante's Inferno, some have attempted to turn the crime against the criminal, in clever and often gruesome ways. Modern Western legal systems usually state as their goal the reform or re-education of a convicted criminal. Even in these systems, however, society is considered the victim of a criminal's actions, and the notion of vengeance for such acts is an important part of the concept of justice — a criminal "pays his debt to society". Psychologists have found that the thwarted psychological expectation of revenge may lead to issues of victimhood.[citation needed] Arabia during Muhammad's era[edit]         v t e   List of battles of Prophet Muhammad        Ghazwah (expeditions where he took part)  Abwa Buwat Safwan Dul 1st Badr Kudr Sawiq Qaynuqa Thi Bahran Uhud Asad Nadir 2nd Nejd 2nd Badr Jandal Trench Qurayza Lahyan Mustaliq Treaty Khaybar Fadak Qura Dhat Baqra Mecca Hunayn Autas Ta'if Tabouk  Sariyyah (expeditions which he ordered)  Raids Nakhla 1st Nejd Qatan Unais Raji Damri Bir Atik Maslamah Ukasha 1st Thala 2nd Thala Qarad Jumum Is 3rd Thala Hisma Zaid Auf 1st Ali Wadi Kurz Rawaha Umar Bakr Bashir Mayfah Ghalib Yemen Sulami Kadid Layth Shuja Ka'b Mu'tah 1st Amr Ubaidah Hadrad Edam Khadirah Khalid 2nd Amr Sa'd Jadh Tufail 1st Autas 2nd Autas Tamim Khatham Dahhak Jeddah 3rd Ali Udhrah 3rd Khalid 4th Khalid Sufyan Jurash Najran Mudhij Hamdan Dhul Army of Usama (Final Expedition)         Main article: List of battles of Muhammad The Islamic Prophet Muhammad ordered many military campaigns as retaliation or revenge for his slain comrades. Likewise his enemies also took revenge against Muslims. One of the earliest examples was during the Expedition of Al Raji ordered by Muhammad in 625.[10] During this expedition some men requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam,[10] but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers.[11] According to William Montgomery Watt, the seven men Muhammad sent may have been spies for Muhammad and instructors for Arab tribes.[12] Watt's claim that they were spies and not missionaries is mentioned in the Sunni hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari [13] The Battle of the Trench took place in February 627 [14] because the Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa tribes formed an alliance with the Quraysh to attack Muhammad as revenge for expelling them from Medina.[15][16] The Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir states: "The reason why the Confederates came was that a group of the leaders of the Jews of Banu Nadir, whom the Messenger of Allah had expelled from Al-Madinah to Khaybar, including Sallam bin Abu Al-Huqayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Kinanah bin Ar-Rabi`, went to Makkah where they met with the leaders of Quraysh and incited them to make war against the Prophet" [17] Muhammad also ordered the Second Raid on Banu Thalabah in August 627 [18][19][20] to attack the tribe as revenge for the 1st failed raid in which 9 Muslims died.[21] This was followed by the Invasion of Banu Lahyan in September 627 [18][19] where he ordered his followers to attack to get revenge for the killing of 10 Muslims in the Expedition of Al Raji.[21] The Banu Lahyan tribe fled.[21] Muhammad also ordered the Second Expedition of Wadi al-Qura in January 628 [19] to raid the inhabitants as revenge after a number of Muslims were killed in a previous failed attempt.[22] 30 horsemen[22] and 1 woman were killed by the Muslim army[23] with many more captured.[23] Proverbs[edit] The popular expression "revenge is a dish best served cold" suggests that revenge is more satisfying if enacted when unexpected or long feared, inverting traditional civilized revulsion toward 'cold-blooded' violence.[24] The idea's origin is obscure. The French diplomat Talleyrand (1754–1838) has been credited with the saying La vengeance est un mets que l'on doit manger froid. [Revenge is a dish that should be eaten cold.], albeit without supporting detail.[25] It has been in the English language at least since the 1846 translation of the 1845 French novel Mathilde by Joseph Marie Eugène Sue: la vengeance se mange très-bien froide,[26] there italicized as if quoting a proverbial saying, and translated revenge is very good eaten cold.[27] It has been wrongly credited[28] to the novel Les liaisons dangereuses (1782). Its path to modern popularity may begin with the 1949 film Kind Hearts and Coronets which had revenge is a dish which people of taste prefer to eat cold. The familiar wording appears in the film Death Rides a Horse (1967), in the novel The Godfather by Mario Puzo (1969), as if from an "old Klingon Proverb" in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and again in the title sequence of the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003) wherein it was jestfully cited as a Klingon proverb. Another proverb states: "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves." This is a translation of Confucius teaching - and he meant something quite different from what it seems in the English translation. The original version begins with "复仇不子也." It literally means a gentleman who does not take revenge is not a gentleman. He then added, "寝苫枕干不仕弗与共天下也遇诸市朝不反兵而斗." It means a gentleman may not take his revenge right away due to the circumstances but he will remember it every day before falling into sleep. He then shall take the revenge when the timing is right, even if he must take the whole world with him (to end his own life). In other words, Confucius was not encouraging people to let go of the hatred, rather he reminds people the importance of revenge as it is part of the significance of one's dignity, and he was encouraging people to "dig two graves" because he believes that dignity is more important than one's life. The phrase has also been credited to the Pashto people of Aghanistan.[29] In the arts[edit]     Igagoe buyuden. This is an episode from a popular story of revenge--how the son of a murdered samurai tracked the killer over all Japan.   Revenge is a popular subject in literature, drama, and other arts. Notable examples include the plays Hamlet and Othello by William Shakespeare, the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and the short story "The Cask of Amontillado" by Edgar Allan Poe. Other examples are the Greek myths of Medea, the painting Herodias' Revenge by Juan de Flandes, the opera Don Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the novel The Princess Bride by William Goldman. In Japanese art, revenge is a theme in various woodblock prints depicting the Revenge of the Forty-Seven Ronin by many well-known and influential artists, including Kuniyoshi. The Chinese playwright Ji Junxiang used revenge as the central theme in his theatrical work The Orphan of Zhao;[30] it depicts more specifically familial revenge, which is placed in the context of Confucian morality and social hierarchical structure.[31] Some modern societies use tales of revenge to provide catharsis, or to condition their members against acting out of desire for retribution.[citation needed] In many of these works, tragedy is compounded when the person seeking revenge realizes they have become what they wished to destroy. However, in others, the consummation is depicted as satisfying and cathartic. See also[edit]    Look up revenge in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
