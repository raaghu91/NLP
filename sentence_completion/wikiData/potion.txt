In mythology and literature, a potion is usually made by a magician, dragon, fairy or witch and has magical properties. It is used for various motives including the healing, bewitching or poisoning of people. For example, love potions for those who wish to fall in love (or become deeply infatuated) with another (the love potion figures tragically into most versions of the tale of Tristan and Iseult, including Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde); sleeping potions to cause long-term or eternal sleep (in folklore, this can range from the normal REM sleep to a deathlike coma); and elixirs heal/cure any wound/malady (as in C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe). Goscinny and Uderzo's character Asterix the Gaul gained superhuman strength from a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix. Creation of potions of different kinds was a common practice of alchemy, and was commonly associated with witchcraft, as in The Tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare. During the 19th century, it was common in certain countries to see wandering charlatans offering curative potions. These were eventually dismissed as quackery.     Illustration by Arthur Rackham to Richard Wagner's Siegfried: While Siegfried reforges the sword Nothung, Mime prepares a sleeping potion to use on him.   In modern fantasy, potions are often portrayed as spells in liquid form, capable of causing a variety of effects, including healing, amnesia, infatuation, transformation, invisibility, and invulnerability.[1] Potions have also gained popularity as a standard item in video games, usually as a healing item. The availability of healing potions in the popular Final Fantasy series of games eventually resulted in the release of an actual beverage named "Potion" in Japan by Square Enix, the games' creators.[citation needed] See also[edit]  Concoction Elixir Herbal tea Tincture  References[edit]   ^ John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, "Potions", p 779 ISBN 0-312-19869-8   External links[edit]  Poisoning in the Middle Ages          v t e   Witchcraft and magic       Types    African witchcraft  Vodun Witch smeller   Asian witchcraft  Kulam Onmyōdō   Australasian witchcraft  Makutu   European witchcraft  Akelarre Benandanti Brujería Cunning folk Seiðr Völva White witch Witch-cult hypothesis   North American witchcraft  21 Divisiones Granny woman Hoodoo Huna Pow-wow Santería Vodou Voodoo   South American witchcraft  Candomblé   Contemporary witchcraft  Feri Tradition Kitchen witchcraft Stregheria Wicca           Practices    Animism Coven Demon Divination Entheogen Evocation Familiar spirit Flying ointment Jinn Magic Necromancy Occultism Poppet Potions Prayer Satanic ritual abuse Satanism Shamanism Sigils Spiritism Spiritualism Witch ball Witch's ladder         Objects    Amulet Broom Cloak of invisibility Magic carpet Magic ring Magic sword Talisman Wand         Folklore and mythology    Agamede Aradia Baba Yaga Daayan Drude Elbow witch Huld Kalku Hecate Circe Medea Muma Pădurii Obayifo Sea witch Sorginak Spearfinger Three Witches Witch of Endor         Major historic treatises    Formicarius Malleus Maleficarum Summis desiderantes affectibus
