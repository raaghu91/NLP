It includes more specific mental states such as happiness, entertainment, enjoyment, ecstasy, and euphoria. In psychology, the pleasure principle describes pleasure as a positive feedback mechanism, motivating the organism to recreate in the future the situation which it has just found pleasurable. According to this theory, organisms are similarly motivated to avoid situations that have caused pain in the past.[citation needed] The experience of pleasure is subjective and different individuals will experience different kinds and amounts of pleasure in the same situation. Many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives, such as eating, exercise, hygiene, sex or defecation. Other pleasurable experiences are associated with social experiences and social drives, such as the experiences of accomplishment, recognition, and service. The appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as art, music, dancing, and literature is often pleasurable. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the brain mechanisms underlying pleasure.[1] One of the key discoveries was made by Kent C. Berridge who has shown that pleasure is not a unitary experience. Rather, pleasure consists of multiple brain processes including liking, wanting and learning subserved by distinct yet partially overlapping brain networks.[2] In particular, this research has been helped by the use of objective pleasure-elicited reactions in humans and other animals such as the behavioral ‘liking’/‘disliking’ facial expressions to tastes that are homologous between humans and many other mammals.[3] Recreational drug use can be pleasurable: some drugs, illicit and otherwise, directly create euphoria in the human brain when ingested. The mind's natural tendency to seek out more of this feeling (as described by the pleasure principle) can lead to dependence and addiction. Berridge and Robinson have proposed that addiction results from drugs hijacking the ‘wanting’ system through a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system.[4]    Contents   1 Neurobiology 2 Psychology 3 Philosophical views  3.1 Philosophies of pleasure   4 As a uniquely human experience 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading    Neurobiology[edit] The pleasure center is the set of brain structures, predominantly the nucleus accumbens, theorized to produce great pleasure when stimulated electrically. Some references state that the septum pellucidium is generally considered to be the pleasure center,[5] while others mention the hypothalamus when referring to the pleasure center for intracranial stimulation.[6] Certain chemicals are known to stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain.[citation needed] It has been suggested that physical exertion can release endorphines in what is called the runner's high, and equally it has been found that chocolate and certain spices, such as from the family of the chilli, can release or cause to be released similar psychoactive chemicals to those released during sexual acts.[citation needed] Psychology[edit] The degree to which something or someone is experienced as pleasurable not only depends on its objective attributes (appearance, sound, taste, texture, etc.), but on beliefs about its history, about the circumstances of its creation, about its rarity, fame, or price, and on other non-intrinsic attributes, such as the social status or identity it conveys. For example, a sweater that has been worn by a celebrity will be more desired than an otherwise identical sweater that has not, though considerably less so if it has been washed.[7] Another example was when Grammy-winning, internationally-acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell played in the Washington D.C. subway for 43 minutes, attracting little attention from the 1,097 people who passed by, and earning about $59 in tips.[7][8][9] Paul Bloom describes these phenomena as arising from a form of essentialism. Some people find things pleasurable which have adverse objective attributes, such as horror films and spicy food.

He concludes that human needs and desires are endless, and "their satisfaction is by definition impossible."[13] The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer understood pleasure as a negative sensation, one that negates the usual existential condition of suffering.[14] Philosophies of pleasure[edit] Utilitarianism and Hedonism are philosophies that advocate increasing to the maximum the amount of pleasure and minimizing the amount of suffering. As a uniquely human experience[edit] See also: Reward system § Animals vs humans and Animal sexual behaviour § Sex for pleasure There has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind. Jeremy Bentham (usually regarded as the founder of Utilitarianism)[15] and Beth Dixon[16] both argue that animals do experience pleasure — the latter, however, in a carefully worded manner. People who believe in human exceptionalism might argue that it is a form of anthropomorphism to ascribe any human experience to animals, including pleasure. Others view animal behaviour simply as responses to stimuli; this is the way behaviourists look at the evidence, Pavlov's dogs (or rather his explanation of their behaviour) being the best-known example. However, it may be argued that we simply cannot know whether animals experience pleasure, and most scientists, indeed, prefer to remain neutral while using anthropomorphisms as and when they need them.[17] It appears, though, that those who recognise emotions in other animals are in the ascent: many ethologists, for example Marc Bekoff, are prepared to draw the conclusion that animals do experience emotions, though these are not necessarily the same as human emotions.[18] See also[edit]   Part of a series on   Utilitarianism     Predecessors    Epicurus David Hume Claude Adrien Helvétius William Godwin Francis Hutcheson William Paley          Key people    Jeremy Bentham John Stuart Mill Henry Sidgwick Richard Mervyn Hare Peter Singer          Types of utilitarianism    Preference Rule Act Two-level Total Average Negative Hedonism Enlightened self-interest          Key concepts    Pain Suffering Pleasure Utility Happiness Eudaimonia Consequentialism Felicific calculus          Problems    Mere addition paradox Paradox of hedonism Utility monster          Related topics    Rational choice theory Game theory Social choice Neoclassical economics        Politics portal      v t e         Wikiquote has quotations related to: Pleasure      Look up pleasure in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
