Boasting or bragging is the act of making an ostentatious speech.[1] It is considered a vice by major religious groups such as Islam,[2] Hinduism,[3] and Buddhism.[4] Boasting has also been studied by such evolutionary psychologists as Robert Wright,[5] and can involve magnifying an accomplishment out of proportion to its importance.[6] See also[edit]   Beot Bomphiologia Dominance (ethology) Exaggeration Hubris Miles Gloriosus, a boasting stock character from ancient Roman comedy Narcissism One-upmanship Puffery Rodomontade Schadenfreude Self-esteem Self-promotion   References[edit]   ^ Noah Webster (1844).
