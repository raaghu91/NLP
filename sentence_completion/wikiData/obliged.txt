(file)     Adjective[edit] obliged (comparative more obliged, superlative most obliged)  Under an obligation to do something for someone. Indebted because of a favor done.  Usage notes[edit] In sense “under obligation”, synonymous with obligated, though the latter is only used in American English and some dialects such as Scottish,[1] not standard British.[2] In dialects where both obliged and obligated are used, there is no standard distinction drawn, though individuals may distinguish nuance or use idiosyncratically. In technical discussions, particularly legal ones such as The Concept of Law by H. L. A. Hart (1961), the words may carry different meanings, such as obligations inherent to a relationship versus ones externally imposed.
