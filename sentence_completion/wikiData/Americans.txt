As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance.[39] Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.[40]    Contents   1 Overview 2 Racial and ethnic groups  2.1 White and European Americans 2.2 Hispanic and Latino Americans 2.3 Black and African Americans 2.4 Asian Americans 2.5 American Indians and Alaska Natives 2.6 Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 2.7 Two or more races   3 National personification 4 Language 5 Religion 6 Culture 7 American diaspora 8 See also 9 Footnotes 10 References    Overview[edit] Main articles: Race and ethnicity in the United States, Colonial United States and Immigration to the United States The majority of Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries, with the exception of the Native American population and people from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippine Islands who became American through expansion of the country in the 19th century,[41] and American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands in the 20th century.[42] Despite its multi-ethnic composition,[43][44] the culture of the United States held in common by most Americans can also be referred to as mainstream "American culture", a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Northern and Western European colonists, settlers, and immigrants.[43] It also includes influences of African-American culture.[45] Westward expansion integrated the Creoles and Cajuns of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest and brought close contact with the culture of Mexico. Large-scale immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from Southern and Eastern Europe introduced a variety of elements. Immigration from Asia, Africa, and Latin America has also had impact. A cultural melting pot, or pluralistic salad bowl, describes the way in which generations of Americans have celebrated and exchanged distinctive cultural characteristics.[43] In addition to the United States, Americans and people of American descent can be found internationally. As many as seven million Americans are estimated to be living abroad, and make up the American diaspora.[46][47][48] Racial and ethnic groups[edit] Main article: Race and ethnicity in the United States See also: Demographics of the United States    2010 U.S Census [49]Table 1[50]   Self-identified Race   Percent of population    White alone      72.4%   African American      12.6%   Asian      4.8%   American Indians and Alaska Natives      0.9%   Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders      0.2%   Two or more races      2.9%   Some Other Race      6.2%   Total      100%   Hispanic and Latino American (of any race): 16.3%[51]    The United States of America is a diverse country, racially, and ethnically.[52] Six races are officially recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes: White, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and people of two or more races. "Some other race" is also an option in the census and other surveys.[53][54][55] The United States Census Bureau also classifies Americans as "Hispanic or Latino" and "Not Hispanic or Latino", which identifies Hispanic and Latino Americans as a racially diverse ethnicity that comprises the largest minority group in the nation.[53][54][56] White and European Americans[edit] Main articles: European American, White American, White Hispanic and Latino Americans, Iranian American, Arab American and Jewish American People of European descent, or whites, constitute the majority of the 308 million people living in the United States, with 74.8% of the population in the 2010 United States Census.[a][49][58] They are considered people who trace their ancestry to the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.[49] Of those reporting to be White American, 7,487,133 reported to be Multiracial; with largest combination being white and black.[58] Additionally, there are 29,184,290 White Hispanics or Latinos.[58] Non-Hispanic Whites are the majority in 46 states. There are four minority-majority states: California, Texas, New Mexico, and Hawaii.[49] In addition, the District of Columbia has a non-white majority.[49] The state with the highest percentage of non-Hispanic White Americans is Maine.[59] The largest continental ancestral group of Americans are that of Europeans who have origins in any of the original peoples of Europe. This includes people via African, North American, Caribbean, Central American or South American and Oceanian nations that have a large European diaspora.[60] The Spanish were the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the United States.[61] Martín de Argüelles born 1566, San Agustín, La Florida, was the first person of European descent born in what is now the United States.[62] Twenty-one years later, Virginia Dare born 1587 Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina, was the first child born in the Thirteen Colonies to English parents. In 2009, German Americans (16.5%), Irish Americans (11.9%), and English Americans (9.0%) were the three largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States, collectively comprising 37.4% of the population.[63] Overall, as the largest group, European Americans have the lowest poverty rate[64] and the second highest educational attainment levels, median household income,[65] and median personal income[66] of any racial demographic in the nation.

In the State of Texas, Spaniards first settled the region in the late 1600s and formed a unique cultural group known as Tejanos.

In addition, there were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which represented 12.1% of the population.[81] This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans,[80] making up 14% of the total population of the United States.[c][82] African Americans make up the second largest race in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race);[71] the majority of the population (55%) live in the South, while compared to 2000 Census there is a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[82] Most African Americans are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States, although some are—or are descended from—immigrants from African, Caribbean, Central American or South American nations.[83] As an adjective, the term is usually spelled African-American.[84] More recent immigrants from Africa may, or may not, self-identify as "African-American";[85][86] and may experience conflict with American-born African-Americans.[87][88][89][90] The first African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[91] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[92] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[93] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[94][95] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[96] By 1804, the northern states (north of the Mason-Dixon Line) had abolished slavery.[97] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[98] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[99] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[100] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act due to the Civil Rights Movement.[101]   Population by ancestry group[68]   Rank Ancestry group Percentage of total est. population Pop. estimates         Dred Scott    Frederick Douglass    Martin Luther King, Jr.      Colin Powell (Jamaican and Scottish)    W.

The largest sub-groups are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Cambodia, Mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, Laos, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Asians overall have higher income levels than all other racial groups in the United States, including whites, and the trend appears to be increasing in relation to those groups.[106] Additionally, Asians have a higher education attainment level than all other racial groups in the United States.[107][108] For better or worse, the group has been called a model minority.[109][110][111] While Asian Americans have been in what is now the United States since before the Revolutionary War,[112][113][114] relatively large waves of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese immigration did not begin until the mid-to-late 19th century.[114] Immigration and significant population growth continue to this day.[115] Due to a number of factors, Asian Americans have been stereotyped as "perpetual foreigners".[116][117]   Asian ancestries[102]   Rank Ancestry Percentage of total population Pop.

Multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population;[103] by the 2010 census the Multiracial increased to 9,009,073, or 2.9% of the total population.[140] They can be any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, "Some other race") and ethnicities.[141] The largest population of Multiracial Americans were those of White and African American descent, with a total of 1,834,212 self-identifying individuals.[140] Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States, is biracial with his mother being of English and Irish descent and his father being of Kenyan birth;[142][143] however, Obama only self-identifies as being African American.[144][145]   Population by selected Two or More Races Population[146]   Rank Specific Combinations Percentage of total population Pop.

The image bears resemblance to the real Samuel Wilson. The female personification, primarily popular during the 18th and 19th centuries, is "Columbia".   A national personification is an anthropomorphism of a nation or its people; it can appear in both editorial cartoons and propaganda. Uncle Sam is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the American government, with the first usage of the term dating from the War of 1812. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a goatee beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of the flag of the United States – for example, typically a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers. Columbia is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America, made famous by African-American poet Phillis Wheatley during the American Revolutionary War in 1776. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, including the District of Columbia, the seat of government of the United States. Language[edit] Main articles: Languages of the United States, English language, American English and English-only  Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in 2010[147]  Language Percent of population Number of speakers   English 80% 233,780,338   Combined total of all languages other than English 20% 57,048,617   Spanish (excluding Puerto Rico and Spanish Creole) 12% 35,437,985   Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin) 0.9% 2,567,779   Tagalog 0.5% 1,542,118   Vietnamese 0.4% 1,292,448   French 0.4% 1,288,833   Korean 0.4% 1,108,408   German 0.4% 1,107,869   English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[148][149] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states.[150] Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law.[151] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[152] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms.[153] Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.

The First Amendment to the country's Constitution prevents the Federal government from making any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a "very important" role in their lives, a proportion unusual among developed countries, although similar to the other nations of the Americas.[155] Many faiths have flourished in the United States, including both later imports spanning the country's multicultural immigrant heritage, as well as those founded within the country; these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world.[156] The majority of Americans (76%) identify themselves as Christians, mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations, accounting for 51% and 25% of the population respectively.[157] Non-Christian religions (including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism), collectively make up about 4% to 5% of the adult population.[157][158][159] Another 15% of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation.[157] According to the American Religious Identification Survey, religious belief varies considerably across the country: 59% of Americans living in Western states (the "Unchurched Belt") report a belief in God, yet in the South (the "Bible Belt") the figure is as high as 86%.[157][160] Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans, Pennsylvania by Irish and English Quakers, Maryland by English and Irish Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the 19th century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.[161] Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.[162]        The First Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island          The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. is the largest Catholic church in the United States.          Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah is the largest temple of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.          Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island is America's oldest surviving synagogue.          The Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan is the largest mosque in North America.          Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California is one of the largest Buddhist temples in the Western Hemisphere.          Hindu Temple at Malibu, California     Culture[edit] Main article: Culture of the United States     American shepherd with his horse and dog.   The culture of the United States is primarily a Western culture but is influenced by Native American, African, Asian, Polynesian, and Latin American cultures. The United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine, and folklore.[44] Its chief early European influences came from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers of colonial America during British rule. British culture, due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language, legal system and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence.[163] Other important influences came from other parts of Europe, especially Germany,[164] France,[165] and Italy.[citation needed] Original elements also play a strong role, such as Jeffersonian democracy.[166] Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America's domestic originality was degenerate.[166] Prevalent ideas and ideals that evolved domestically, such as national holidays, uniquely American sports, military tradition,[167] and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole.[168] American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. individualism, egalitarianism, and faith in freedom and democracy), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity.
