With other ex-Playground members Paul Wright (bass), Paul Dudeney (drums, metal percussion) and James Machin (guitar) & Steven Wright (FX`S). Splintered sought to push the previous band's noise excursions to denser realms. They picked up interest from several underground record labels and garnered some attention as part of a subculture of industrial and experimental groups in the UK, including Terminal Cheesecake, Skullflower, Ramleh, Loop and Godflesh. The band used an array of other instruments, samples, multi-layered guitars, powerful rhythms and often submerged, shouted vocals. Other members who joined the group included Steve Pittis (Band of Pain, Dirter Promotions) and Colin Bradley (Dual). The first album featured Stefx (Headbutt) on drums when Paul Dudeney failed to make the recording sessions. In 1997, James and the two Pauls decided they needed a break and could not face a European tour arranged for the same year. Richo, aided by Colin Bradley (tabletop guitar/electronics), assembled a final line-up for this that consisted of Stuart Carter (Heroin, Sarcasm, The Fields of Hay) on bass, Hassni Malik (dROME, The Vitamin B12) on guitar and James Hodson (later of Faust) on drums, percussion and flute. Once over, and following the release of another album in 1998, the group once again dissolved and during the course of the next two years got replaced by a new group, Theme, which consisted of Richo, Stuart and Hassni. Theme continue to this day and have a third album out on Israel's HCB Recordings in Autumn 2009. Side projects[edit] Splintered were involved in several other projects along the way as well. These were usually activated by Richo and Steve Pittis, plus often involved other members of the group as well as others. These projects were Husk, A.S.P., Slugbait and Band Of Pain. All of them had releases out, on both Steve Pittis and Richo's respective labels and others such as Ralf Wehowsky's Selektion, Meeuw Muzak and Cold Spring Records. Band Of Pain then became the main concern for Steve Pittis and continues to record to this day, with a new album scheduled for 2010.
