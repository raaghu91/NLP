(December 2013)   Confusion (from Latin confusĭo, -ōnis, from confundere: "to pour together;" "to mingle together;" "to confuse") is the state of being bewildered or unclear in one’s mind about something.    Contents   1 Medical term 2 Causes  2.1 Differential diagnosis   3 See also 4 References 5 External links    Medical term[edit]  Mental Confusion Classifications  ICD-10 R41.0   ICD-9 298.9   MedlinePlus 003205   MeSH D003221   The term, "acute mental confusion"[1] is often used interchangeably with delirium[2] in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology. These refer to the loss of orientation, or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location; and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material).[3] Causes[edit] Mental confusion may result from drug side effects[4] or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction. Acute confusion is often called delirium (or "acute confusional state"),[5] although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion. These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness; and temporal or spatial dis-orientation. Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as dementia, as well. Differential diagnosis[edit] Further information: Differential diagnosis The most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are dopaminergic drugs (used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease), diuretics, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The elderly, and especially those with pre-existing dementia, are most at risk for drug induced acute confusional states.[6] New research is finding a link between Vitamin D deficiency and cognitive impairment (which includes 'foggy brain').[7] See also[edit]  Cognitive distortion  References[edit]   ^ Confusion Definition; Oxford Dictionary online. ^ Delirium; Symptom Finder online ; accessed . ^ thefreedictionary.com Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers; 2007; Saunders. ^ Waters, Jo (2 April 2012).
