(March 2014)   Expeditus is said to have been a Roman centurion in Armenia who was martyred around April 303 in what is now Turkey, for converting to Christianity. Considered the patron saint of speedy cases, he is commemorated by the Roman Catholic Church on April 18.

He was a Christian martyr, but not much else is known about him. Information concerning Saint Expeditus is found in the Hieronymian Martyrology. According to Delehaye, the word "Expeditus" is a misreading of "Elpidius".[1] The name "Expeditus" has provoked puns, so he has become the saint of rapidity. At first, he was invoked for urgent causes; he has since become the patron of dealers, sailors, students, and examinees; he is also implored for success in lawsuits. Given that "Expeditus" is Latin for a soldier without marching pack, i.e. a soldier with light equipment, this saint may be an anonymous individual known by his "profession". His cult was already developed in Turin, Italy in the Middle Ages. At the beginning of the twentieth century, certain bishops tried but failed to abolish the cult of Saint Expeditus. Roman Catholic veneration[edit] Legends[edit] According to tradition, Saint Expeditus was a Roman centurion in Armenia who became a Christian and was beheaded during the Diocletian Persecution in 303 A.D. The day he decided to become a Christian, the Devil took the form of a crow (a snake in some versions of the legend) and told him to defer his conversion until the next day. Expeditus stamped on the bird and killed it, declaring, "I'll be a Christian today!" Expeditus was included in martyrologies in Italy before 1781.[3] There was a tradition that Saint Expeditus could be called upon to help settle overly long legal cases. His acta have not been reviewed by the Roman Catholic Church, and his feast of April 19 is not widely celebrated. Saint Expedite is venerated in Europe and strongly in Latin America. Brazil has ceremonies in São Paulo and crowds attending ceremonies to mark his April 19 feast day can reach in the hundreds of thousands. Many stories circulated about the saint's origin say that the cultus of Expeditus began when a package marked expedite (meaning 'be ready' or alternately 'loosen') arrived with unidentified relics or statues. The recipients assumed that the statuary or relics belonged to a Saint Expeditus, and so veneration began. Such an account is set in France in 1781. A case containing the relics of a saint, who was formerly buried in the Denfert-Rochereau catacombs of Paris, was delivered at a convent in the city. The senders had written expédit on the case, to ensure fast delivery of the remains. The nuns assumed that "Expédit" was the name of a martyr, and prayed for his intercession. When their prayers were answered, veneration spread rapidly through France and on to other Roman Catholic countries.[3] Another version of the story takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was strongly influenced by French Catholic culture through the colonial period. This account says that Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel (New Orleans) received a large shipment of statues of various saints, and that one case lacked an identifying label. It was labeled "Expedite" (Expédit in French), so the residents assumed that must be the saint's name.[3] In New Orleans, Saint Expédit still figures prominently in Louisiana Creole folklore and is revered through amulets, flowers, candles, and intercessory prayers.[4] Iconographical depiction[edit] Expeditus' typical depiction in artwork is as a young Roman centurion. The soldier is squashing a crow beneath his right foot and bearing a clock in early images. Later depictions have Expeditus holding a cross, inscribed with the Latin word hodie ("today"). A banderole with the word cras ("tomorrow" in Latin) emerges from the crow's mouth. Although the English language tends to mimic a crow's cry as "caw caw," Italian renders it as "cra cra.",[5] and the ancient Romans rendered it as "cras cras". Réunion Island[edit]     Roadside altars dedicated to Saint Expédit are common in Réunion and always painted red.   Saint Expédit has a significant folk following on the French island of Réunion off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Stories about the origin of his veneration follow the typical formula: a mysterious parcel marked with expedit arrived as an aid to instill pious virtues in the people.[6] Another version says that Expédit acquired his name through his help in placing vengeful curses. Decapitated statues of the saint are often found, the defacement inflicted in anger for a request not carried out, or in order to break an existing curse.[6] Road-side altars dedicated to Saint Expédit can be as small as a box containing a small statue of the saint, or as large as a hut, containing multiple statues, candles, and flowers. In all cases, these altars are painted a bright red.[6] Also common are ex-votos thanking Saint Expédit for wishes granted and favors received. In Réunion, the cult of Saint Expédit has been syncretic, with Roman Catholicism absorbing other beliefs from Madagascar or India. Saint Expédit is a popular saint, revered by Reunionnais regardless of age or religion. As the worship of Saint Expédit is officially considered taboo, people do not generally visit the altars in the open. But, the altars are widespread on the island and obviously well-tended, showing that the cult is active. Chile[edit]    Himnos mil al glorioso Expedito, que su sangre en la Armenia vertió, cuyo nombre en el cielo fue escrito, y de mártir el laurel alcanzó. —Himno a San Expedito[7]   A thousand hymns to glorious Expeditus, Who shed his blood in Armenia, Whose name was written in heaven, And gained the laurel of martyrdom. —Hymn to Saint Expeditus    Veneration in Chile is said to have begun when a devotee of Expeditus (or locally in Spanish, San Expedito) brought an image of him to Viña del Mar, one of the most popular beach cities of Chile. She petitioned some local priests for help to have a small church built for him. It is said that local authorities initially rejected the idea, but the priests and the devout lady prayed to Expeditus, and in less than nine days they had the approval. Since then, the cult of San Expedito has become increasingly popular in Chile; from rich to poor, people pray novenas to him. The shrine in the Reñaca sector of Viña is a rather popular pilgrimage site, especially during summer. Vodou and Hoodoo[edit] In Haitian Vodou the image of St. Expedite is used to represent Baron Lakwa, a spirit associated with death, cemeteries, and sex. In New Orleans Voodoo, the saint often represents Baron Samedi, the spirit of death or an aspect of the spirit of death. The saint is also often invoked in the African-American magical tradition of Hoodoo, where it is customary to make an offering to him of a glass of water, a bunch of flowers and a pound cake. In this tradition, his image is used in gambling charms and rituals believed to bring down curses on others. Adherents especially venerate the 4/6 domino tile. The use of Catholic Saints as representations of spirits and deities in other worship practices extends beyond St. Expedite. Other saints syncretised into such worship include St. Patrick, St. Anthony of Padua and The Virgin Mary. According to Maya Deren in her book, Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti, St. Expedite is the representation of M. Entretoute. He is featured as one of the prominent death spirits of the Ghede pantheon.
