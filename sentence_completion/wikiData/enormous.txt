Enormous cite their influences as Ray Davies, Difford & Tilbrook, Burt Bacharach, The Beatles, Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello. Their classic pop songs are reminiscent of Buzzcocks, The Kinks, Squeeze, Madness, The Smiths, The Wonder Stuff, Blur, The Cure, The Divine Comedy, The Teardrop Explodes, and The Clash. During 1996, David Graham (bass, vocals) left the band to join the Royal Air Force and was replaced by Craig Denholm (bass, vocals). Steve Foster, of Bandwagon Studios, Mansfield, England, brought together four music groups, under one banner named The Red Collective, featuring: Enormous; Ease; The Swells; and The Kerrys. Enormous formed the backbone and were signed to Beatific Records in 1997, recording a various artists compilation album Cigarette Machine From God (1997) at Mansfield's Bandwagon Studios. Their songs were critically acclaimed, receiving music reviews by The Sunday Times[2] and Mojo.[3] After 2003, Steve O'Toole and Craig Denholm departed and the remaining band members took a three year break to follow their own projects. By 2006, the band had reformed and was signed by the independent record label, Big Arena Records, for the purpose of re-releasing their entire back catalogue. In 2008, two temporary band members, Steve Giles (bass, vocals) and Stephen Capes (keyboards) were recruited, and the band played a sold-out homecoming gig in Mansfield at the Town Mill venue,[4] on 20 November 2008. New bassist Mike Ridley-Dash joined in December 2009, and Travis Peters (keyboards) joined the band in 2010.
