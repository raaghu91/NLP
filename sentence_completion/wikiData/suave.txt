Targeting discount stores, the brand represents more than 100 products including shampoo, lotions, soaps and deodorant.[1][2][3] History[edit] Suave was started by National Mineral Company in the United States in 1937 as a hair tonic.[4] The brand eventually was acquired by Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.[4][5][6] which, in the 1970s, started expanding the Suave name beyond hair care into other areas. The brand targeted discount stores and grew its offerings to more than 100 products including shampoo, lotions, soaps and deodorant.[1][2][3] In 1996, Helen Curtis—and thus, Suave—were acquired by Unilever. Currently based in Chicago, IL, the brand name is used in the United States, Argentina, Mexico and Canada. References[edit]   ^ a b c "Suave®". unileverusa.com.  ^ a b Gianna Passarelli.
