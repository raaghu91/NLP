(December 2009)       A shopkeeper in Assam, India   A shopkeeper is an individual who owns or runs a shop. Also known as a "Storey". Generally, shop employees are not shopkeepers, but are often incorrectly referred to as shopkeepers. At larger companies, a shopkeeper is usually referred to as a manager, since the owner is not able to manage the business being a single shopkeeper, so this term could apply to larger firms (in particular, multiple shops) generally and be a separate duty. Job descriptions[edit] Shopkeepers may manage their own independent corner shop or run a franchise store on behalf of a retail chain. Unlike store managers who usually work for a large retailer, shopkeepers will normally have overall responsibility for a store. Independent shopkeepers include (but are not limited to) grocers, corner shops, newsagents, butchers, bakers, booksellers, florists, and antique dealers. A shopkeeper would serve clients at a counter and carry out other duties such as taking customer payments, giving change, helping customers and wrapping gifts and purchases. Most of the time shopkeepers are answering customer’s enquiries, giving advice about products to customers and listening to customers’ needs and requests, which can indicate new sales opportunities. They also calculate daily takings, prepare wages, deposit cash at the bank, book-keep and stocktake to ensure that the stocks are available all the time. Ordering stock from wholesalers, manufacturers, agents and importers, sometimes this task can also given to small shop keeper if the shop is too small and don't have purchaser.
