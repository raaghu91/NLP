(May 2007)   Legislation (or "statutory law") is law which has been promulgated (or "enacted") by a legislature or other governing body or the process of making it.[1] (Another source of law is judge-made law or case law.) Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to proscribe, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.[2] Under the Westminster system, an item of primary legislation is known as an Act of Parliament after enactment. Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before passage. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given session.[3] Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government. Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the separation of powers. Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to interpret legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term legislation is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term primary legislation may be used to exclude these other forms. Dead letter[edit] The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.

Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)  ^ Senate.gov           v t e   Law       Core subjects    Administrative law Constitutional law Contract Criminal law Deed Equity Evidence International law Law of obligations Procedure  Civil Criminal   Property law Public law Restitution Statutory law Tort            Other subjects    Agricultural law Aviation law Banking law Bankruptcy Commercial law Competition law Conflict of laws Construction law Consumer protection Corporate law Cyberlaw Election law Energy law Entertainment law Environmental law Family law Financial regulation Health law Immigration law Intellectual property International criminal law International human rights International slavery laws Labour law Law of war Legal archaeology Legal fiction Maritime law Media law Military law Probate  Estate Will and testament   Product liability Public international law Space law Sports law Tax law Trust law         Sources of law    Charter Constitution Custom Divine right Human rights Natural and legal rights Precedent  Case law           Law making    Ballot measure Codification Decree  Edict Executive order Proclamation   Legislation  Delegated legislation Regulation Rulemaking   Promulgation Repeal Statutory law  Statute Act of Parliament Act of Congress   Treaty         Legal systems    Civil law Common law Chinese law Legal pluralism Natural law Religious law  Canon law Hindu law Jewish law Sharia   Roman law Socialist law Statutory law Xeer Yassa         Legal theory    Critical legal studies Comparative law Feminist Law and economics Legal formalism History International legal theory Principle of legality Rule of law Sociology         Jurisprudence    Adjudication Administration of justice Criminal justice Court-martial Dispute resolution Fiqh Lawsuit/Litigation Legal opinion Legal remedy Judge  Justice of the peace Magistrate   Judgment Judicial review Jurisdiction Jury Justice Practice of law  Attorney Barrister Counsel Lawyer Legal representation Prosecutor Solicitor   Question of fact Question of law Trial Trial advocacy Trier of fact Verdict         Legal institutions    Bureaucracy The bar The bench Civil society Court Election commission Executive Judiciary Law enforcement Legal education  Law school   Legislature Military Police Tribunal            Category Index Outline Portal            This law-related article is a stub.
