This article is about the name.  For other uses, see Wesley (disambiguation).    Look up Wesley in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.   Wesley, a shortened version of "Wesleydale", is a name with an Anglo-Norman etymology. The "wes" portion of the name refers to the Western cardinal direction, while the word "lea" refers to a field, pasture, or other clearing in a forest.[1] Thus, the name's origin refers to a "western lea," or a field to the west.[2] The name was predominantly used as a surname until John Wesley, founder of the Methodist church, inspired some parents to name their sons after him while also retaining the parents' own surname.
