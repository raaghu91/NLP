The role of a Catholic Catechist is to catechize (teach) the Faith of the Catholic Church both by word and example.

However, increasingly the role of the Parish Catechist has been undertaken by Catholic Laity. In addition to the parish, catechizing also takes place in the Catholic schools through more formal classes as part of their curriculum. Catechists are often deployed to teach Candidates who are preparing for the Sacraments of Reconciliation, First Holy Communion, Confirmation and the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA). Various age appropriate religious education texts and materials used for instruction as well as the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Catechists have always been of particular importance in large geographical parishes, such as in Africa, where Priests have historically only been able to visit different parts of their Parish periodically. In the Priest's absence the Parish Catechist takes on the role of being the main teacher of the faith in that Parish. As such they are afforded a particular place of honour within the parish community where they work.[2] More recently Catechists have become increasingly important in the older western areas of the Catholic Church mainly due to the dramatic fall in the number of Priests and Religious in these regions. In this regard the west is more inexperienced than other younger regions of the Catholic Church in the selection, formation, oversight, and utilisation of Catechists. General Instruction of the Roman Missal[edit] The General Instruction of the Roman Missal allows for institution of Catechists should a particular Bishops' Conference feel that it is required. A Bishops' Conference may request permission from the Apostolic See:   “ ...if they judge the establishment of such offices in their region to be necessary or very useful because of special reasons. To these belong, for example, the ministries of porter, exorcist, catechist, as well as others to be conferred on those who are dedicated to works of charity, where this ministry had not been assigned to deacons.[3] ”   Guide for Catechists[edit] In 1993 the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples published the Guide for Catechsists, with a sub-heading of Document of vocational, formative and promotional orientation of Catechists in the territories dependent on the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.[2] This document was therefore intended only for Catechists at work in the missionary territories of the Church. It also made a very specific distinction between the Catechists working in these areas and Catechists at work in "older Churches" such as in the west. As such the detailed framework and structure this document outlines for the selection, formation, oversight and deployment of Catechists within the "mission territories" has not necessarily been applied to Catechists at work elsewhere within the Catholic Church. In the Introduction to this document it states:   “ The Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples experiences directly the undisputed effectiveness of lay catechists. Under the direction of priests, in fact, they continue with frankness to announce "the Good News" to their brothers and sisters of other religions, preparing them for entry into the ecclesial community through baptism. Through religious instruction, preparation for the sacraments, animation of prayer and other works of charity, they help the baptised to grow in the fervour of the Christian life. Where there is a shortage of priests, the catechists are also entrusted with the pastoral guidance of the little community separated from the Centre. Often, they are called to witness to their faith by harsh trials and painful privations.The history of evangelisation past and present attests to their constancy even to the giving of life itself. Catechists are truly the pride of the missionary Church![2] ”   Note with Pastoral Recommendations for the Year of Faith[edit] On 6 January 2012, the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published the Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith.[4] This document provides some explanation and suggestions at different levels in preparation for the Year of Faith which was declared by Benedict XVI with the Apostolic Letter of 11 October 2011 Porta fidei. This year is due to begin on 11 October 2012, on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Ecumenical Vatican Council, and will end on 24 November 2013, the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ, Universal King.[4] This note make the following recommendations in relation to Catechsists: At the Diocesan Level[edit] 2. It would be desirable that each Diocese in the world organize a study day on the Catechism of the Catholic Church, particularly for its priests, consecrated persons and catechists.[4] 5. It would be appropriate for each particular Church to review the reception of Vatican Council II and the Catechism of the Catholic Church in its own life and mission, particularly in the realm of catechesis. This would provide the opportunity for a renewal of commitment on the part of the catechetical offices of the Dioceses which - supported by the Commissions for Catechesis of the Episcopal Conferences – have the duty to care for the theological formation of catechists.[4] At Parish Level[edit] 4. Catechists should hold more firmly to the doctrinal richness of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and, under the direction of their pastors, offer guidance in reading this precious document to groups of faithful, working toward a deeper common understanding thereof, with the goal of creating small communities of faith, and of giving witness to the Lord Jesus.[4]  Recognition of the Ministry of Catechist[edit] There is increasing awareness, acknowledgement and recognition by the Church Hierarchy of the important role Catechists play in the life of the Catholic Church, and with it the responsibilities the Church has towards them. The latter is clear from the explicit reference in the Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith highlighting the "duty of care" each local Bishop has towards the theological formation of the Catechists at work within their Diocese.[4] See also[edit]     Catholicism portal      Catholic spirituality Lay ecclesial ministry Life Teen Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults Universal call to holiness Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church World Youth Day   References[edit]   ^ The Free Dictionary - catechist ^ a b c Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples - Guide for Catechists ^ Ministeria Quaedam ^ a b c d e f Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith   External links[edit]  General Directory for Catechesis   Commentary on the General Directory for Catechesis   The Marian Catechist Apostolate          v t e   Catholic Youth Ministry       Concepts    Catholic residential youth work Catholic schools CCD CYO Newman Centers         Organizations    Catholic Christian Outreach CFC – Youth for Christ Columbian Squires ECyD FOCUS Guild of St. Stephen Jesus Youth Life Teen Malankara Catholic Youth Movement NET Ministries Oblate Youth Australia Squire Roses Youth 2000         Events    Lednica 2000 World Youth Day                 v t e   Catholic Church        Organizations, papacy, teachings and liturgical traditions       History    Jesus Twelve Apostles Early Christianity History of the papacy Ecumenical Councils Missions Great Schism of East Crusades Great Schism of West Protestant Reformation Counter-Reformation Catholic Church by country Vatican City  index              Hierarchy    Pope Cardinals Patriarchs Major Archbishops Primates Metropolitans Archbishops Diocesan Bishops Coadjutor Bishops Auxiliary Bishops Titular Bishops Bishops Emeriti         Theology    Body and Soul Divine Grace Dogma One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church Original sin Salvation Sermon on the Mount The Ten Commandments Trinity Worship         Sacraments    Anointing of the Sick Baptism Confirmation Eucharist Holy Orders Matrimony Penance         Mariology    Roman Catholic Mariology Assumption History of Mariology Immaculate Conception Mariology of the popes Mariology of the saints Mother of God Perpetual Virginity Veneration         Doctors of the Church        Gregory the Great Ambrose Augustine of Hippo Jerome John Chrysostom Basil of Caesarea Gregory of Nazianzus Athanasius of Alexandria Cyril of Alexandria Cyril of Jerusalem John of Damascus Bede the Venerable Ephrem the Syrian Thomas Aquinas Bonaventure Anselm of Canterbury Isidore of Seville Peter Chrysologus Leo the Great Peter Damian Bernard of Clairvaux Hilary of Poitiers Alphonsus Liguori Francis de Sales Peter Canisius John of the Cross Robert Bellarmine Albertus Magnus Anthony of Padua Lawrence of Brindisi Teresa of Ávila Catherine of Siena Thérèse of Lisieux John of Ávila Hildegard of Bingen Gregory of Narek            Pope Francis    Conclave Inauguration Theology Canonizations Visits         Preceding popes    Pope Benedict XVI Pope John Paul II Pope John Paul I Pope Paul VI Pope John XXIII Pope Pius XII Pope Pius XI Pope Benedict XV Pope Pius X Pope Leo XIII         Religious institutes and similar    Assumptionists Augustinians Benedictines Capuchin Order Carmelites Carthusians Congregations of Holy Cross Dominican Order Franciscan orders Jesuits Oratory of Saint Philip Neri         Vatican II    Definition of the Church Dei verbum Gaudium et spes Lumen gentium Nostra aetate Sacrosanctum Concilium         Particular Churches and liturgical rites    Alexandrian Coptic Ethiopic  Eritrean Ethiopian   Antiochian Maronite Syriac Syro-Malankara Armenian Armenian Byzantine Albanian Belarusian Bulgarian Croatian Greek Hungarian Italo-Albanian Macedonian Melkite Romanian Russian Ruthenian Slovak Ukrainian East Syrian Chaldean Syro-Malabar Latin Roman Anglican Use Sarum Ambrosian Mozarabic             Catholicism portal  Pope portal
