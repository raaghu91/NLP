    Basketball player Kevin Durant, after receiving the gold medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship   Gratification is the pleasurable emotional reaction of happiness in response to a fulfillment of a desire or goal. Gratification, like all emotions, is a motivator of behavior and thus plays a role in the entire range of human social systems.

Criticism[edit] While one might say that those who lack the skill to delay are immature, an excess of this skill can create problems as well; i.e. an individual becomes inflexible, or unable to take pleasure in life (anhedonia) and seize opportunities for fear of adverse consequences.[4] However, it is said that individuals who seek wisdom tend to attain the fortitude to apply equal balance. There are also circumstances, in an uncertain/negative environment, when seizing gratification is the rational approach,[5] as in wartime.[6] Bipolar[edit] Gratification becomes a major issue in manic-depression. One sign of the onset of depression is a spreading loss of the sense of gratification in such immediate things as friendship, jokes, conversation, food and sex.[7] Long-term gratifications seem even more meaningless.[8] By contrast, the manic can find gratification in almost anything, even a leaf falling, for example.[9] See also[edit]   anhedonia contentment deferred gratification pleasure cost-benefit analysis uses and gratifications theory utilitarianism Social sciences   References[edit]   ^ R.
