(September 2013)         ACTED (French: Agence d'Aide à la Coopération Technique Et au Développement), formerly 'Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development', is a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization set up in 1993. The organization employs approximately 198 international staff and more than 3500 national staff. The headquarters are based in Paris, France.[1]    Contents   1 History 2 Goals 3 Services 4 Vision 5 Countries of activity 6 External links 7 References    History[edit] The first projects were initiated in Kabul in 1993 to bring relief to populations affected by more than 15 years of conflict. ACTED activities then rapidly expanded to the entire country and subsequently to neighboring countries in 1996 (namely Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan), with the aim of developing a regional strategy throughout Central Asia. The organization continued its expansion, opening offices in Central Africa in 1997, in order to help populations affected by the Congo-Brazzaville conflict, in Central America in 1998 following the “Hurricane Mitch” disaster, in the Balkans after the conflict in Kosovo, and in the Middle-East, in 2003, to support Iraqi population. In 2004, ACTED continued its involvement in Central Africa by opening missions in Chad and Sudan to respond to the Darfur crisis. In 2005, the organization started emergency reconstruction activities in South Asia after the tsunami disaster, and expanded its areas of intervention to India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. ACTED has implemented programmes in the Middle East since 2007, intervening in Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories. More recently, ACTED intervened to provide relief to the populations of Africa, with new programmes starting in the Central African Republic, Kenya and Somalia in 2008. Our teams are also providing relief and supporting the populations of Myanmar affected by the Nargis Cyclone and are implementing projects in Vietnam since 2008. ACTED has been implementing Food security interventions for the populations of Zimbabwe since October 2009, and is also present in Cambodia on HIV/AIDS prevention activities. In 2011, ACTED started programmes in Jordan, as well has responded to the emergencies in Libya and Côte d'Ivoire. The Bopha typhoon in 2012 mobilised ACTED in the Philippines, while a regional office was set up in Bangkok to support in parallel Myanmar refugees in Thailand. ACTED also responds to the refugee crises in South Sudan, Jordan and Iraq. In 2013 ACTED responded to the typhoon Haiyan emergency in the Philippines and is now accompanying the recovery of affected populations and the rehabilitation phase. ACTED teams remain fully mobilized today in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Active in the region since 2004 and committed in assisting vulnerable Syrian refugees and host populations since the very beginning of this crisis, ACTED has expanded relief operations to ensure continued access to essential human needs, as the population and their needs rapidly expanded and evolved in the last 12 months.[2] Goals[edit] ACTED is a humanitarian organization which intervenes in times of crisis, either immediately (emergency and rehabilitation projects), or in the medium and long term (development projects), under the following conditions:  disasters linked to human factors natural disasters economic and social crises [3]  Services[edit]  Emergency humanitarian aid Food safety Promotion of health issues Education and job training Economic development Microcredit Advocacy Promotion of cultural issues  [4] Vision[edit] ACTED is a French international solidarity organisation driven by a mission to support vulnerable populations throughout the world and to accompany them in building a better future by providing an adapted response to specific needs since 1993. One of the main French international solidarity associations, ACTED assists populations affected by crisis with a global but also local approach that is multidisciplinary and adapted to each context. By ensuring the link between Emergency, Rehabilitation and Development, ACTED teams guaranty that interventions in periods of crisis are also useful in the long term, because only long term support – by remaining after the emergency and involving communities – can stop the poverty cycle and accompany populations towards long term development. To this end our teams in the field intervene in 35 countries with over 388 projects in the following sectors: emergency humanitarian aid, food security, health promotion, education and training, economic development, microfinance, institutional support, regional dialogue and cultural promotion. With extensive experience in responding to the most vulnerable community needs and situations throughout the world, ACTED is today a contributor to the international agenda for the Millenium Development Goals, with advocacy campaigns in France and in Europe. ACTED is engaged in the promotion and development of innovative initiatives and approaches, humanitarian principles, new solidarity and convergences between private and public actors and NGOs from the North and the South, on topics such as microfinance, social business, local governance promotion, evaluation and emergency humanitarian aid coordination support, culture and development, sustainable development, access to health etc.[5] Countries of activity[edit] ACTED intervenes in 34 countries spanning 5 zones (Asia, Africa, America, Europe, Middle-East). The organization tries whenever possible to develop a regional approach to crisis situations in countries where cross-border population movements are important factors. This regional approach is backed-up by an integrated approach enabling ACTED to work in such varied activity fields as micro-economics, public health or even cultural promotion.[6] Specifically, ACTED has had a presence in the following countries:    Afghanistan  Burma  Cambodia  Central African Republic  Chad  Congo  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Haiti  India  Indonesia  Iraq  Ivory Coast  Jordan  Kenya  Kyrgyzstan  Libya  Lebanon  Mali  Nicaragua  Pakistan  Palestine  Philippines  Somalia  South Sudan  Sri Lanka  Sudan  Syria  Tajikistan  Thailand  Uganda  Uzbekistan  Vietnam  Yemen   External links[edit]  homepage ACTED homepage Oxus homepage Convergences homepage REACH homepage Alliance2015  References[edit]   ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are ^ http://www.acted.org/en/who-we-are
