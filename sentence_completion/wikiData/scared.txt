(September 2012)     Scared      Studio album by Swingin' Utters   Released 1992   Recorded The House Of Faith in Palo Alto, California, 1991   Genre Punk rock   Length 22:19   Label Quality of Life   Swingin' Utters chronology      Gives You Strength (1992) Scared (1992) No Eager Men (1994)      Scared was the first full-length album by California punk rock band Swingin' Utters, released in 1992, following the EP Gives You Strength, released earlier the same year. The cover calls the band "Johnny Peebucks and the Swingin' Utters", the name they originally used before shortening it ("Johnny Peebucks" being singer Johnny Bonnel). Because this album was originally released on 10-inch vinyl, and only limited numbers exist, all of these tracks appear on the 1996 compilation CD, More Scared, although in a different order. The first pressing of the original 10-inch vinyl was on black vinyl and the second pressing was on a black/white splatter colored vinyl.
