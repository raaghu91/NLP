The Evince motto sums up the project aim: "Simply a Document Viewer".[4] GNOME has included Evince since the release of GNOME 2.12 in September 2005. It is written mainly in C, with a small part (the code that interfaces with poppler) written in C++. A large number of Linux distributions include Evince as the default document viewer including Ubuntu, Fedora and Linux Mint. Evince is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.

Evince quickly surpassed the functionality of GPdf and replaced both GPdf and GGV in the September 2005 release of GNOME 2.12.[5][6] Evince is included on the VALO-CD, a collection of "all the best Windows programs".[7][8] Features[edit] Evince incorporates an integrated search that displays the number of results found and highlights the results on the page. Users can optionally display (in the left sidebar of the viewer) thumbnails of pages to assist in page navigation within a document. When documents support indices, Evince gives the option of showing the document index for quickly moving from one section to another.[9] Evince can show two pages at a time, left and right, and offers full-screen and slide-show views. Evince allows the selection of text in PDF files and allows users to highlight and copy text from documents made from scanned images, if the PDF includes OCR data. Evince used to obey the DRM restrictions of PDF files, which may prevent copying, printing, or converting some PDF files, however this has been made optional, and turned off by default in gconf.[10][11][12][13] Supported document formats[edit] Evince supports many different single and multi-page document formats:[14]  Built-in support   PDF using the Poppler backend PostScript using the Ghostscript backend. The Windows package of Evince ships with a copy of Ghostscript's libgs version 8, so no external Ghostscript installation is needed on that platform.[citation needed] Multi-Page TIFF DVI DjVu using the DjVuLibre backend OpenDocument Presentation when built with the --enable-impress option Images (currently included as a toy, but needs work) CBR, CBZ, CB7 (Comic Book Archive file)   Optional support   XPS   Possible or planned support   Microsoft PowerPoint using libpreview (currently alpha-quality) MS Word OpenDocument AbiWord  See also[edit]     Free software portal     List of PDF software  References[edit]   ^ "Evince/Team - GNOME Live!". wiki.gnome.org. 2011-08-06.
