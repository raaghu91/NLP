As popularity of the Lucid Dream Mixes and DIVE radio shows grew, Elucidate began remixing for several trance labels and in 2007 released their first remixes.[5] Near the end of 2007, Elucidate produced a bootleg remix of the trance classic "Skydive". Their remix of "Skydive" achieved major support from many of the world's biggest DJ's including Ferry Corsten,[6] and propelled them into the forefront of the mainstream trance scene. After releasing their "Skydive" remix, Elucidate put out over 20 productions in 2008 and 2009 including originals and remixes[1] on several major trance record labels including Bonzai,[7] Alter Ego,[1] Neuroscience,[8] and Perfecto.[1] Style[edit] The musical style produced and performed by Elucidate is a subgenre of electronica, known as trance music. Although many people associate trance with non-vocal instrumental songs,[9] Elucidate songs and mixes typically contain chilling vocals.[10] The style of music created by Elucidate is normally made using synthesizers, virtual studio technology instruments, and digital audio workstations. Elucidate songs include synth pads, lush strings, and driving beats,[11][12] typifying the typical production sound found in modern trance music.[9] Discography[edit]  Originals   2008: Elucidate feat.
