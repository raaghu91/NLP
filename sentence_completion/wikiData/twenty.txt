Accordingly, 20 is the third abundant number and demonstrates an 8-member aliquot sequence; {20, 22, 14, 10, 8, 7, 1, 0}. 20 is the smallest primitive abundant number. 20 is the 4th composite number in the 7-aliquot tree. Two numbers have 20 as their aliquot sum; the discrete semiprime 34 and the squared prime 361. Only 2 other square primes are abundant 12 and 18. An icosahedron has 20 faces. A dodecahedron has 20 vertices. 20 can be written as the sum of three Fibonacci numbers uniquely, i.e. 20 = 13 + 5 + 2. The product of the number of divisors and the number of proper divisors of 20 is exactly 20. 20 is the number of quarter or half turns required to optimally solve a Rubik's Cube in the worst case. 20 is the only number with more than one digit that can be written from base 2 to base 20 using only the digits 0 to 9.[2]  In science[edit]  The atomic number of calcium.

In some countries, the number 20 is used as an index in measuring visual acuity. 20/20 indicates normal vision at 20 feet, although it is commonly used to mean "perfect vision" (Note that this applies only to countries using the Imperial system. The metric equivalent is 6/6). When someone is able to see only after an event how things turned out, that person is often said to have had "20/20 hindsight".  As an indefinite number[edit]  A 'score' is a group of 20 (often used in combination with a cardinal number, i.e. fourscore to mean 80), but also often used as an indefinite number[3] (e.g. the newspaper headline "Scores of Typhoon Survivors Flown to Manila")[4]  In sports[edit]     A standard dartboard is laid out as 20 sectors    The jersey number 20 has been retired by several North American sports teams in honor of past playing greats:  In Major League Baseball:  The Arizona Diamondbacks, for Luis Gonzalez.
