For other uses, see Sharon (disambiguation). Sharon (Hebrew: שָׁרוֹן, Tiberian Hebrew: Šārôn) is a female name that can be spelled with one "r" or two (Sharron).[citation needed] In some countries (like Israel), Sharon is a unisex name. It derives from an Israelite place name meaning "forest" in Hebrew, referring to a fertile plain near the coast of Israel. This gives its name to a type of flowering shrub, the rose of Sharon. Sharon is one of many names that could formerly be applied to males (as in the 19th-century historian Sharon Turner), but is now nearly always used of females (cf. Vivian, Ashley, Beverly, etc.). It began being used as a female name sometime in the early part of the 20th century, first being listed as one of the 1000 most popular names for females born in the United States in 1925. By the mid-1940s, it had become an extremely popular name for newborn American girls, remaining a top 10 name for most of the decade, peaking at #8 in both 1943 and 1945. Its popularity began to steadily decline thereafter; the name fell out of the top 100 after 1977, and out of the top 500 after 2001.[1] In the United Kingdom its popularity peaked during the 1960s. It was the 10th most popular female name by 1964 and was still as high as 17th in 1974, but a sharp decline in popularity followed and since the 1980s it has not even featured in the top 100.[2]    Contents   1 People with the given name  1.1 Masculine given name   2 People with the surname 3 Fictional characters 4 Places 5 References    People with the given name[edit]  Sharon Bruneau, Canadian female bodybuilder and fitness competitor Sharon Chan, Hong Kong actress Sharon Claydon, Australian politician Sharon Cohen, more commonly known as Dana International, an Israeli pop singer Sharon Corr, Irish musician and member of The Corrs Sharon Creech, author of children's books Walk Two Moons and Ruby Holler Sharon Cuneta, Filipina actress and talk show host  Sharon (talk show), the television show hosted by Sharon Cuneta   Sharon Dahlonega Raiford Bush, American TV personality Sharron Davies (born 1962), British swimmer Sharon den Adel, co-founder of and singer for Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation Sharon Dijksma (born 1971), Dutch politician Sharon Epperson, CNBC correspondent Sharon Fichman, Canadian/Israeli tennis player Sharon Gaetz, Canadian politician Sharon Gibson, English javelin thrower Sharon Hanson, American heptathlete Sharon Jaklofsky, Australian-Dutch athlete Sharon Jordan, American film and television actress Sharon Kips, Dutch singer Sharon Lawrence, American television actress Sharon Leal, American actress and director Sharon Lee (writer), American novelist Sharon Maguire, British film director Sharon Mann, American voice actress working in Paris, France Sharron McClellan, American action-adventure author Sharon Osbourne, English music promoter and TV personality, wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne Sharon Redd, American singer Sharon Rendle, British judoka Sharon Shannon, Irish musician Sharon Stephen, Son of Jigida (Musical artist -http://www.bollynook.com/en/lyrics/14058/aye-jigida/) and Steven Stevens.
