United States[edit] In the United States, solicitation is the name of a crime, an inchoate offense that consists of a person offering money or inducing another to commit a crime with the specific intent that the person solicited commit the crime. Differences in laws[edit] In the United States, the term "solicitation" implies some part of commercial element, consideration, or payment. In some other common law countries,[which?] the situation is different:  where the substantive offense is not committed, the charges are drawn from incitement, conspiracy, and attempt; where the substantive offense is committed, the charges are drawn from conspiracy, counseling and procuring (see accessories), and the substantive offenses as joint principals (see common purpose).  Differences from other crimes[edit] Main article: Inchoate offence Solicitation has in the U.S. these unique elements:  the encouraging, bribing, requesting, or commanding a person to commit a substantive crime, with the intent that the person solicited actually commit the crime.  Unlike conspiracy, there is no overt step necessary for solicitation, one person can be a defendant, and it merges with the substantive crime. It is not necessary that the person actually commit the crime, nor is it necessary that the person solicited be willing or able to commit the crime (such as if the "solicitee" were an undercover police officer). For example, if Alice commands Bob to assault Charlie, and Alice intends for Bob to assault Charlie, then Alice is guilty of solicitation. However, if Alice commands Bob to assault Charlie without intending that an actual crime be committed (perhaps believing that Charlie has given consent), then there is no solicitation. An interesting twist on solicitation occurs when a third party that the solicitor did not intend to receive the incitement overhears the request to the original solicitee and unbeknownst to the solicitor, commits the target offense. In a minority of jurisdictions in the United States, this situation would still be considered solicitation even though the defendant never intended the person that committed the crime to have done so. Solicitation is also subject to the doctrine of merger, which applies in situations where the person solicited actually commits the crime. In such a situation, both Alice and Bob could be charged with the crime as accomplices, which would preclude conviction under solicitation; a person cannot be punished for both solicitation and the crime solicited. No soliciting signs – residential[edit] In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to ignore "no soliciting" signs with the burden typically resting upon the solicitor to look for the sign and upon observation to vacate the premises without attempting to contact the homeowner.[2][3] Some cities require the employer to properly train employees on the appropriate observation of local solicitation ordinances and instruct them to always carry an identifying badge that they must show upon request.[4] City ordinances vary but may require a soliciting sign to be of a certain dimension to qualify for legal protection. Some signs are designed to clearly cite the city ordinance and describe the consequences to the solicitor.[5] Although certainly not required, such methods may be more effective at deterring unwanted solicitation. No soliciting signs – commercial[edit]      This section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources.

(April 2011)          No soliciting signs are intended to protect business from panhandlers or individuals attempting to sell products or services to that business' patrons on business property, thus taking potential revenue away from that business. It is a common misconception that a simple "no soliciting" sign is meant to keep individuals from attempting to speak with a business owner or principal about his products or services. While this may be accomplished using a more detailed sign specifically asking vendors not to promote themselves to employees or principals, most sales professionals are taught to bypass simple "no soliciting" signs and interpret them to mean "do not solicit our patrons".
