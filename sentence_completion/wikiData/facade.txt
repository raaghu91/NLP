A facade or façade (/fəˈsɑːd/) is generally one exterior side of a building, usually, but not always, the front. The word comes from the French language, literally meaning "frontage" or "face". In architecture, the facade of a building is often the most important aspect from a design standpoint, as it sets the tone for the rest of the building. From the engineering perspective of a building, the facade is also of great importance due to its impact on energy efficiency.[1] Many facades are historical, and local zoning regulations or other laws greatly restrict or even forbid their alteration.

The earliest usage recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is 1656.[2] Georgian facades added to earlier buildings[edit] It was quite common in the Georgian period for existing houses in English towns to be given a fashionable new facade. For example, in the city of Bath, The Bunch of Grapes in Westgate Street appears to be a Georgian building, but the appearance is only skin deep and some of the interior rooms still have Jacobean plasterwork ceilings.[3] Highrise facades[edit] In modern highrise building, the exterior walls are often suspended from the concrete floor slabs. Examples include curtain walls and precast concrete walls. The facade can at times be required to have a fire-resistance rating, for instance, if two buildings are very close together, to lower the likelihood of fire spreading from one building to another. In general, the facade systems that are suspended or attached to the precast concrete slabs will be made from aluminium (powdercoated or anodized) or stainless steel. In recent years more lavish materials such as titanium have sometimes been used, but due to their cost and susceptibility to panel edge staining these have not been popular. Whether rated or not, fire protection is always a design consideration. The melting point of aluminium, 660 °C (1,220 °F), is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified, too. Putting fire sprinkler systems on each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls. Some building codes also limit the percentage of window area in exterior walls. When the exterior wall is not rated, the perimeter slab edge becomes a junction where rated slabs are abutting an unrated wall. For rated walls, one may also choose rated windows and fire doors, to maintain that wall's rating. high rise facade does mean a high raised building. usually we use aluminium structure to make an exterior facade. after the aluminium structure the exterior grade laminate is being used. it cost almost 450 - 500 per sqr ft. really this is a very costly system. but it seems the beauitification of the entire building. the high pressure laminate is water resistant, sun light resistant, weather resistant, uv rays resistant.. Film sets and theme parks[edit] On a film set and within most themed attractions, many of the buildings are only facades, which are far cheaper than actual buildings, and not subject to building codes (within film sets). In film sets, they are simply held up with supports from behind, and sometimes have boxes for actors to step in and out of from the front if necessary for a scene. Within theme parks, they are usually decoration for the interior ride/attraction/restaurant, which is based on a simple building design. Gallery[edit]        The facade at Bletchley Park, United Kingdom is a mix of architectural styles.          Prague.          Façade of the town hall in Chojna, Poland.          Prairie Lights Bookstore, Iowa City, facade designed to resemble a human face.          The Haunted Mansion in Disneyland consists of a building and facade in the front, while the majority of the ride is outside the park in a connected building.          "Energetic Rebuilding of a Facade": The outer walls are torn off and replaced at one wing of the building at a time while the other wing part is still/again in use. (Germany)     Figurative meaning[edit]    Look up facade in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.   The word can be used as a figure of speech to describe the "face" that people show other people, as opposed to what they really think or do.
