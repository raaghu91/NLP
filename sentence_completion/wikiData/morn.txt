(November 2007)         This is a list of secondary characters from the science fiction television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Characters are ordered alphabetically by family name, and only characters who played a significant major role in the series are listed.    Contents   1 Recurring characters  1.1 Bareil Antos 1.2 Brunt 1.3 Cretak, Kimara 1.4 Damar 1.5 Dax 1.6 Dukat 1.7 Eddington, Michael 1.8 Fontaine, Vic 1.9 Garak, Elim 1.10 Gowron 1.11 Ishka 1.12 Leeta 1.13 Martok 1.14 Mila 1.15 Mora Pol 1.16 Morn 1.17 Nog 1.18 O'Brien, Keiko 1.19 O'Brien, Molly 1.20 Opaka Sulan 1.21 Rom 1.22 Ross, William J. 1.23 Shakaar Edon 1.24 Sisko, Joseph 1.25 Sloan, Luther 1.26 Tain, Enabran 1.27 Tora Ziyal 1.28 Weyoun 1.29 Winn Adami 1.30 Yates, Kasidy 1.31 Zek   2 See also 3 References 4 External links    Recurring characters[edit] Bareil Antos[edit] Bareil Antos was a Bajoran Vedek. He was played by Philip Anglim. Bareil becomes romantically involved with Major Kira Nerys of the Deep Space Nine space station. He runs against Vedek Winn Adami for the role of Kai, but is forced to drop out to protect the reputation of the previous Kai, Opaka. Bareil is injured in a shuttle explosion, and Dr. Julian Bashir has to replace his failing organs with cybernetics so that he can continue to advise Winn in negotiations with the Cardassians. His continued efforts in this weakened state cause brain damage, and eventually his death. In the mirror universe, Bareil Antos is a petty thief who is close to the alternate Kira. He leaves his universe in a foiled attempt to steal an orb. Brunt[edit] Brunt is a liquidator with the Ferengi Commerce Authority (FCA), portrayed by Jeffrey Combs. He is the nemesis of Quark, whom he perceives as a threat to the Ferengi way of life, and often attempts to either destroy him or supplant Grand Nagus Zek (although at one time, he did help Quark rescue Ishka from the Dominion). By sharp contrast, his mirror universe counterpart was a friendly and congenial person, with unrequited feelings for his universe's Ezri Tigan, who ended up being murdered by the Intendant (mirror-Kira Nerys). Brunt (or his counterpart) appeared in eight episodes beginning with Season Three's "Family Business." Combs has described Brunt as "the IRS guy from Hell". Cretak, Kimara[edit] Kimara Cretak is a representative of the Romulan empire for a short time aboard Deep Space Nine. She is accused of treason against the Star empire and imprisoned in the episode "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges." Kimara Cretak was first portrayed by Megan Cole in "Image in the Sand" and "Shadows and Symbols," and Adrienne Barbeau in "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges." Damar[edit] Damar is a Cardassian military officer portrayed by Casey Biggs. As a glinn, he served under Gul Dukat aboard the freighter Groumall, and later as Legate Dukat's aide when the Cardassian Union joined the Dominion and then captured Deep Space Nine. As the Federation re-took the station, Damar learned that Tora Ziyal had been helping Kira and others undermine them and promptly killed her. This earned him personal enmity from Kira. After Dukat's subsequent mental breakdown following his daughter's death, Damar was promoted to gul, and later to legate. As leader, he learned that the Dominion was merely using the Cardassians as pawns in its effort to conquer the Alpha Quadrant, so he switched sides and encouraged his people to fight the Dominion. As leader of the new Cardassian rebellion, he had to accept Federation aid and advice from a "Starfleet advisor," Commander Kira Nerys. In his struggles as a resistance fighter, particularly when his wife and child were taken and killed by the Dominion, he came to understand the Bajoran perspective during Cardassia's occupation of Bajor. While fighting beside Commander Kira and Elim Garak in a final push to retake Cardassia Prime, Damar was killed in action. Damar appeared in 23 episodes beginning with Season Four's "Return to Grace". Dax[edit] Main article: Dax (Star Trek) Dax is a Trill symbiont, that has been "joined" to nine humanoid Trills:  Lela Dax Tobin Dax Emony Dax Audrid Dax Torias Dax Joran Dax portrayed by Jeff McBride and Leigh McCloskey Curzon Dax portrayed by Frank Owen Smith Jadzia Dax portrayed by Terry Farrell Ezri Dax portrayed by Nicole de Boer  Other Dax hosts were:  Verad Dax portrayed by John Glover Yedrin Dax portrayed by Gary Frank  Dukat[edit] Main article: Dukat (Star Trek) Eddington, Michael[edit] Michael Eddington was a Starfleet security officer holding the rank of lieutenant commander. He was stationed on Deep Space Nine by Starfleet due to their lack of complete trust in Odo. Following orders from a Starfleet admiral, he sabotaged the Defiant‍ '​s cloaking system when Captain Sisko defied orders by taking the ship on a mission to the Gamma Quadrant. On another occasion he was instrumental in helping recover the command staff when, while beaming back to the station, their neural patterns were stored in the station computer and their physical forms were placed in a holosuite program. He later defected to the Maquis after working for them to steal several industrial grade replicators destined for the Cardassian Union. He likened himself and Sisko to characters from Les Miserables ("Jean Valjean" and "Javert", respectively), but was eventually captured and imprisoned. He later died fighting alongside Sisko in a successful attempt to rescue survivors of his Maquis colony from the Jem'Hadar. Michael Eddington was portrayed by Kenneth Marshall, appearing as a semi-regular in the series beginning with Season Three's "The Search, Part I". Fontaine, Vic[edit] Vic Fontaine is a holographic entertainer appearing in a program run in one of Quark's holosuites on the space station Deep Space Nine. He is played by James Darren. Created by a holoprogrammer named Felix, Vic works as a Rat Pack style crooner in an idealized version of 1960s Las Vegas, he is charismatic and extremely perceptive. He is used as an informal counselor by crew-members of Deep Space Nine, and he takes it upon himself to get Odo and Kira together romantically, by giving Odo lessons on how to relax around women so that he can be more expressive around Kira. His program is altered by a "Jack in the box" created by Felix to keep things interesting in the episode "Badda-Bing Badda-Bang." This threatens Vic's holographic existence but intervention by the crew saves him. A rarity among holographic characters, Vic is self-aware and knows he is a hologram (as do the Emergency Medical Hologram and Professor Moriarty). Like the Doctor, Vic has the ability to turn his own program on and off. After Vic helps Nog deal with a traumatic battlefield experience, Nog arranges for Vic's program to run constantly so that Vic can experience a full life within his holodeck environment. Originally the role of Vic was offered to Frank Sinatra, Jr., but he turned it down, as he only wanted to play an alien.[citation needed] The songs that Fontaine sings on Deep Space Nine are on the James Darren album This One's from the Heart. One song not on the album is "The Alamo," which he sings for Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien right before they are going to replay the Alamo battle in the Holosuites. Garak, Elim[edit] Main article: Elim Garak Gowron[edit] Main article: Gowron Ishka[edit] "Ishka" redirects here. For the village in Iran, see Ishka, Iran. Ishka is played once by Andrea Martin and four times by Cecily Adams. Often called "Moogie" by her sons, she is the widow of Keldar, mother of Quark and Rom and grandmother of Nog. An unorthodox Ferengi female, she flouts Ferengi law by wearing clothes and earning profit, much to the consternation of Quark who incurs the wrath of the FCA for her deeds. She became involved with Grand Nagus Zek, first serving as a power-behind-the-throne financial advisor, then influencing him toward instituting societal reforms, such as allowing Ferengi women to wear clothes and earn profit, and finally recommending her son Rom as Zek's successor when he retired as Grand Nagus. At one point she was kidnapped by the Dominion and used for prisoner exchange with a Federation-held Vorta. Ishka appeared in five episodes, beginning with Season Three's "Family Business." Leeta[edit] Leeta is a recurring character on Deep Space Nine, portrayed by Chase Masterson. She is a Bajoran employed as a Dabo girl in Quark's bar. After a brief romantic relationship with Julian Bashir, she married Rom and therefore ended the series as First Lady of Ferenginar. Her defining characteristics are her short red hair, voluptuous figure, and breathy little girl voice. Although initially played as a stereotypical "airhead", over the course of the series it was revealed that she was an intelligent woman who chose to maintain a carefree attitude. She was a ringleader when Quark's employees attempted to start a union, and also volunteered to play temporary host to one of Jadzia Dax's former personalities. She once explained that Dabo girls actually have to be good at math, to ensure that the house always makes a profit. Unlike most Bajoran characters, Leeta was never given a family name. The (non-canon) novels explain that this is because she was brought up in an orphanage during the Bajoran Occupation, and does not have a family name. Martok[edit] Main article: Martok Mila[edit] Mila, played by Julianna McCarthy, was for over three decades the housekeeper of Enabran Tain, the head of the Obsidian Order. Possibly, during their time together, Tain and Mila had a child, whom they named Elim Garak. Due to Tain's position, it was decided to hide the fact that he was Garak's father. No confession from Tain, Mila, or Garak were made supporting this, but Garak does treat Mila as a mother as it is most likely that she was the only such figure in his life. In 2371, Tain considered having Mila killed because she knew too much about him. However, he did not go through with her execution. She was killed by Jem'Hadar soldiers on the eve of Cardassia's liberation from the Dominion. She appeared in several episodes as well as in the novel A Stitch in Time by Andrew J. Robinson. Mora Pol[edit] Doctor Mora Pol was the Bajoran scientist who was assigned to study the Changeling who would become known as Odo. Mora studied and taught Odo at the Bajoran Center for Science during the Occupation of Bajor from 2358–2365. When Odo assumed the shape of a humanoid, he imitated Mora's hairstyle. Odo initially resented Mora for failing to realize he was sentient. Under pressure from the Cardassians to get answers and not fully understanding what he was dealing with, Mora used some questionable methods in his experiments. Odo left the institute two years later. They would not reconcile their differences until 2373, when Mora arrived on Deep Space Nine to assist Odo in treating an infant changeling. Mora Pol was played by actor James Sloyan. Morn[edit] "Morn" redirects here. For the fictional Celt, see Bran Mak Morn. "Morn" looks typographically similar to Mom. Morn, played by Mark Allen Shepherd, is a Lurian male, the only member of his species seen in Star Trek. Morn is a frequent customer in Quark's bar, often present in the background of scenes there. The name, an anagram of "Norm", is a clear homage to Norm Peterson, the ever-present bar patron on the classic American sitcom (and fellow Paramount/CBS series) Cheers. According to make-up designer Michael Westmore, on the first day of filming the series the director chose Morn randomly from among several prosthetic characters. Although Westmore went to great lengths to ensure that Morn could talk if the character ever had a line, he never spoke on camera (though he did laugh); this became a running gag, with other characters commenting several times how talkative he was.[1] Morn is credited with knowing the funniest joke in the universe, and in several episodes an incidental character is seen to start laughing as they leave his side. Quark sometimes breaks down laughing when he tries to retell the joke, and always gives up by saying that no one can tell it like Morn. Despite this, Morn rarely seems to get Quark's jokes, and when he does, it takes him a while. Morn's existence as a fixture at Quark's bar is mocked in the episode "Who Mourns for Morn?" when Quark sets up a holo-imager to project an image of Morn on his regular stool, quietly drinking. No one realizes that it isn't real (to the point of patrons greeting the image as they enter the bar) until Sisko and Dax ran into the bar with exuberance to let people know that Morn died. It's later revealed that he had not died but was, in fact, part of a scam. Often, other characters refer to something Morn has done that, to the viewer, would seem uncharacteristic for Morn. For example, when it became clear that war with the Dominion was inevitable, Morn threw a chair at Quark, then ran naked across the Promenade screaming "We're all doomed!" Following that, he supposedly rushed into a Bajoran temple and threw himself at the feet of Major Kira, begging for forgiveness. Vic Fontaine, the holographic singer who is a recurring character in seasons 6 and 7, has stated that Morn's rendition of "New York, New York" has to be seen to be believed. Lieutenant Commander Worf claimed that Morn was a formidable sparring partner, and the pair fought in the holosuites on a weekly basis. Jadzia Dax also stated having nearly been romantic with Morn, except that Morn turned her down. Very little is revealed about Morn or his species on the show. Quark establishes in "Through the Looking Glass" that Morn has more than one heart. In "The Way of the Warrior," it was implied Lurians are usually found near the Iodite Nebula; a hostile Klingon suggested it was suspicious to find Morn so far from there. It was revealed in the episode "Who Mourns for Morn?" that he had been previously involved in some criminal activities, the most notable being a robbery in which his crew stole 1,000 bricks of gold-pressed latinum. Like all Lurians, Morn has two stomachs; Quark realized that he had extracted the liquid latinum from the bricks and was storing it in one stomach, causing his hair to fall out. Morn regurgitated 100 bricks' worth and gave it to Quark as a reward for helping to get the other thieves arrested. Morn also appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Birthright, Part I" and made a cameo in the Star Trek: Voyager episode "Caretaker." Because of these appearances, this has made Morn one of the few characters to appear in three of the Star Trek series, alongside Quark (who appeared in TNG, DS9, and Voyager), Commander Riker (TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise), Deanna Troi (TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise), Kang (The Original Series, DS9 and Voyager), and Q (TNG, DS9, and Voyager). Nog[edit] Main article: Nog (Star Trek) O'Brien, Keiko[edit] Keiko O'Brien, born Keiko Ishikawa, is played by Rosalind Chao. She is a professional botanist and the wife of Miles O'Brien in both The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Keiko married Miles O'Brien aboard the USS Enterprise-D in the TNG episode "Data's Day". A year later, temporarily stuck in Ten-Forward, she gave birth to a daughter, Molly, with Worf as midwife (TNG episode "Disaster"). When Miles was assigned to Deep Space Nine, Keiko's mother was still living in the city of Kumamoto, Japan. Keiko began talking of visiting her mother after seeing the condition of the space station when first arriving there. Shortly after arriving at Deep Space Nine, Keiko soon decided to start a school. Jake Sisko and Nog were the first students to enroll. Later, Keiko went on a botanical expedition to Bajor. Pregnant with her second child, an accident endangered mother and child on the way back to DS9. Doctor Julian Bashir saved them both by removing the fetus and implanting it into Kira Nerys' womb. In her honor, the child was named "Kirayoshi." When the Dominion War began, Keiko and the children were evacuated from the war zones. They remained away for a time until the fields of battle had shifted far enough to make Deep Space Nine safe again. After the war, the O'Brien family relocated to Earth when Miles became an instructor at Starfleet Academy. O'Brien, Molly[edit] For the country singer, see Mollie O'Brien. Molly O'Brien, played by Hana Hatae, is the daughter of Miles and Keiko O'Brien, and the older sister of Kirayoshi. She originally appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Molly was born in 2368, with Worf delivering her, on the USS Enterprise-D in the TNG episode "Disaster." She moved to Deep Space Nine when Miles was assigned there. In the DS9 episode "Time's Orphan," the O'Briens went on a picnic to Golana IV, where Molly accidentally fell into an abandoned time portal and emerged as an 18-year-old (played by Michelle Krusiec). From her point of view, she had experienced approximately ten years of solitary existence. Back at Deep Space Nine, she was wild and uncontrollable, unable to cope with life on the space station; after a violent altercation in Quark's, Starfleet officials intended to place her in a mental health institution. The O'Briens returned to Golana IV, hoping to send Molly back through the time portal to the place and time she had become accustomed to, preferring her happiness over a possible lifetime of confinement. However, she was returned to the point where she had first entered, allowing the adult Molly to help her child counterpart return home, erasing the adult Molly from history in the process. Opaka Sulan[edit] Opaka Sulan, played by Camille Saviola, was the Kai or spiritual leader of the Bajorans through the latter years of the Cardassian occupation and the first few months after it ended in 2369. Opaka recognized Benjamin Sisko as the long-awaited Emissary of the Prophets, although he did not return her enthusiasm. In response to a prophetic Orb experience, Opaka left Bajor for the first time to pay an unannounced visit to DS9. Journeying with Sisko and Kira through the wormhole, she was killed in a runabout crash on the Ennis penal moon, and was then resurrected by the artificial microbes present there. The microbes were specifically designed to only work on the moon, forcing her to stay behind. She took this as an opportunity to help end the prisoners' fanatical clan war. During the Cardassian occupation, Opaka had been a collaborator: she gave away the whereabouts of a rebel base and her son was killed in the subsequent attack. The Cardassians had threatened to destroy some Bajoran towns so by betraying the rebels (including her own son) she saved thousands of Bajoran lives. Later on, Bareil Antos dropped out of the election for Kai in an effort to keep this secret from ruining Opaka's legacy. This led to the election of the more controversial Winn Adami. In the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels, Opaka was rescued from the Ennis moon by zealous aliens called the Ascendants, after which she roamed the Gamma Quadrant as a healer. She is found by Jake Sisko and returned to Bajor, where she refuses to resume the post of Kai. Rom[edit] Main article: Rom (Star Trek) Ross, William J.[edit] Vice Admiral William J. Ross, played by Barry Jenner, was the Field Commander of Starfleet forces during the Dominion War and was the coordinator of Starfleet's defense of the Bolian and Bajoran fronts in the early stages of that war. His command post was on Starbase 375, where he was in direct command of the 7th Tactical Wing. During the first three months of the war, Ross was under severe pressure to halt the advance of the Dominion. Ross did this by making Captain Sisko his adjutant, to relieve himself of making minor tactical plans and reports. This action gave Ross the initiative to find the "Argolis Cluster Sensor Array." This sensor array was the Dominion's line of sight over all the Bajoran and Bolian fronts at the start of the War. Ross, along with Sisko, planned the attack on the Argolis Array and succeeded in the destruction of the array in late March 2374. As the war progressed, Ross took a much more tactical role rather than strategically planning the war effort. After the first battle of Chin'toka, Ross was posted aboard Deep Space Nine to command the Allied forces presently hemmed in at Chin'toka. It was later revealed that Ross was one of the few Starfleet personnel to know of the existence of Section 31. Although he collaborates with Section 31 in one of their operations, like Julian Bashir he staunchly maintains that he is not a member of the organization. During the Battle of Cardassia, Ross led the Starfleet wing of the assault fleet. He devised the planned assault on Cardassia and, soon afterwards, presided over the signing of the Treaty of Bajor at which he gave a speech to the delegates. His flagship (featured in the 7th season episode "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges") is the Intrepid Class USS Bellerophon. Ross appears in twelve episodes beginning with the Season Six episode "A Time to Stand." Shakaar Edon[edit] Shakaar Edon was a resistance leader, farmer, and later First Minister of Bajor. He was played by Duncan Regehr. A onetime farmer in Bajor's Dahkur Province, Shakaar returned to his fields in 2369 after 25 years of fighting the Cardassian occupiers, only to enter politics as his world's secular leader in 2371. As the head and namesake of Kira's resistance cell, he agreed to let her go on her first raid at age 13 to fill in a vacancy in the ranks, and reteamed with her years later during a near-violent showdown with Kai Winn over the return of promised soil reclamators. After that encounter and the support he received for his handling of it, Shakaar handily won the position as Bajor's second post-occupation First Minister, edging Winn out of her acting role. Shakaar realizes he has fallen in love with Kira a year after his election, during his successful push to cut Bajor's UFP admission timetable in half, though that act was later postponed by Emissary Benjamin Sisko's pagh'tem'far (sacred vision) that advised against it. As his and Kira's affair played out, he had a hard time accepting her carrying the O'Briens' transplanted second child to term after an accident in 2373. Soon afterward, he and Kira part ways romantically, although she still respects him as Bajor's best leader. Shakaar is used to death threats and he routinely ignores them, but a True Way alien operative nearly kills him twice during the Federation conference on DS9, first by sending his turbolift car into free fall, and later by almost getting his quarters depressurized. According to Dukat, Shakaar slept with every woman in his resistance cell except Kira—but Dukat's jealousy of the Major should be taken into account. Shakaar's relationship with Kira ended in 2373 after a visit to the Kendra shrine on Bajor revealed that they were not meant to walk the same path. Sisko, Joseph[edit] Joseph Sisko, father of Captain Benjamin Sisko, was played by Brock Peters (who also played Admiral Cartwright in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country). Joseph ran a restaurant in New Orleans called "Sisko's Creole Kitchen" (DS9: "Image in the Sand"), with a particular specialty each night (generally seafood). While Nog was at Starfleet Academy, he commuted from San Francisco to dine, as Sisko obtained Ferengi tube grubs especially for Nog. Joseph's grandson, Jake Sisko, often worked at the restaurant, and Benjamin worked there after the Pah Wraiths collapsed the wormhole. Joseph was first married to a woman named Sarah, but when their son Benjamin was a year and a half old, Sarah left, eventually moving to Australia and dying in a shuttle accident. Joseph remarried soon after, and Benjamin and his stepmother had such a close relationship Joseph could not bring himself to disclose the truth to his son: that Sarah was, in fact, a Prophet that took physical form. This discovery was made by Benjamin and Jake in the episode "Image in the Sand." Though Joseph Sisko does eventually reveal to Benjamin the truth about Sarah, he vows to take his gumbo recipe "to the grave." Sloan, Luther[edit] Luther Sloan was played by William Sadler. An operative in the secret police organization known as Section 31, Sloan appeared in three episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: "Inquisition," "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges," and "Extreme Measures." In 2374, Sloan placed Dr. Julian Bashir in a psychologically intense holodeck scenario designed to test his loyalties to the Federation. Satisfied that Bashir was a steadfast Starfleet officer, Sloan offered Bashir a position in Section 31, knowing of the doctor's fondness for 20th century espionage fiction. Bashir adamantly refused, but Sloan was content to let him consider the offer. In 2375, Sloan attempted to recruit Bashir for a mission to gather information on Koval, chairman of the Romulan Tal Shiar. Bashir initially declined, but agreed with Captain Sisko that this would allow them to learn more about Section 31's operations and possible connections to Starfleet Command. However, unbeknownst to both of them, Sloan had already enlisted the assistance of Admiral William Ross and thus succeeded in strengthening covert ties to one highly placed Romulan and subverting the career of another. Sloan appeared to perish at Koval's hand, but later appeared in Bashir's quarters to thank him for playing his part and living up to Sloan's high expectations of him. Later that year, Bashir discovered evidence that Section 31 was responsible for infecting Odo with a genocidal virus intended to bring an end to the Dominion War. With the assistance of Miles O'Brien, Bashir lured Sloan to Deep Space Nine and captured him. Rather than risk handing Bashir the cure, Sloan triggered a neuro-depolarizing device in his brain, effectively killing himself. After stabilizing Sloan, Bashir and O'Brien linked their minds to his in a last-ditch effort to secure information that would lead to a cure. While inside Sloan's mind, Bashir was offered secret information that could supposedly bring about the end of Section 31. This was Sloan's way of delaying Bashir from escaping with the knowledge needed to save Odo's life, and the lives of the Founders. Tain, Enabran[edit] Enabran Tain, played by Paul Dooley, was the former head of the Obsidian Order and the biological father of Elim Garak. However, he never admitted this fact publicly, believing that his son was a "weakness [he] couldn't afford." Tain was the head of the Obsidian Order for twenty years, and the only head of the Obsidian Order to live long enough to retire. As the head of the Order, Tain trusted no one, with the exception of his housekeeper, Mila. He was known for his ruthlessness, and many said that he lacked a heart. Tain was also Garak's immediate superior, whom he trained and molded into a mirror image of himself. Nevertheless, Tain was directly responsible for exiling Garak after being betrayed by him in some way. Tain attempted to stage a comeback by destroying the Founders' homeworld with a combined fleet of Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar ships. His plan was compromised by a Changeling infiltrator, and the fleet was destroyed by the Jem'Hadar. Tain was assumed to have perished when his warbird exploded, but he was actually captured by the Dominion and detained at Internment Camp 371. In 2373, Tain modified the camp barracks' life support system to send a subspace signal to Garak, indicating he was alive. By the time Garak reached him, he was dying of heart trouble. On his deathbed, after being sure all his enemies were dead, Tain asked Garak to escape and seek vengeance on the Dominion for what it had done to him. Garak agreed, but only if Tain asked him as his father. Tain died after acknowledging that Garak was his son. Tora Ziyal[edit] Tora Ziyal is the half Cardassian / half Bajoran daughter of Gul Dukat and Tora Naprem. She spent most of her early life with her mother, and thus her name is structured as are all Bajoran names (with the family name first). Her given name, Ziyal, is a popular Cardassian name. She was played by Cyia Batten in "Indiscretion" and "Return to Grace," by Tracy Middendorf in the episode "For the Cause," and by Melanie Smith from "In Purgatory's Shadow" to "Sacrifice of Angels." Ziyal was first introduced in the Season 4 episode "Indiscretion." In this episode, Gul Dukat accompanied Kira Nerys to the crash site of the Cardassian prison transport Ravinok. On the crash site (in the Dozaria system) Kira found out Dukat went along because his mistress (Tora Naprem) was aboard the Ravinok. They discovered the grave of Tora Naprem, and Dukat confessed Tora Naprem and he had a daughter, Tora Ziyal, who was also on the transport. Dukat originally intended on killing Ziyal to protect his career, as it was an abomination for a Cardassian and a Bajoran to have a child, but Kira's arguments and his own paternal love convinced him not to kill his daughter. They found Ziyal in a Breen prison camp on the planet and freed her. Even though her mixed heritage made living on either Cardassia or Bajor unrealistic due to the inherent prejudices, she ended up spending time on Bajor attending a university there. After living there for a short time, Ziyal moved to DS9 where she felt more comfortable and at ease among the station's diverse population, with the bonus of being closer to Major Kira whom she considered a big sister. Shortly after returning to DS9, she entered into a relationship with Elim Garak, which, even though it seemed like a relationship of convenience since they were the only two Cardassians on the station, they grew to have real feelings for one another, much to her father's disdain and condemnation. She briefly evacuated to Bajor after the Cardassian/Dominion troops reclaimed DS9 (Terok Nor) from the Federation but eventually returned to be near her father Gul Dukat and her close friend Kira Nerys. After she came to realize what type of man her father really was, she agreed to help Quark liberate Rom, Kira, Jake and Leeta from prison. They had been imprisoned for attempting to sabotage the Cardassian/Dominion force's planned disarmament of the Federation minefield around the wormhole, which was preventing the Gamma quadrant's Dominion reinforcements from entering the Alpha Quadrant (Season 6 episode "Sacrifice of Angels"). While her father was attempting to convince her to flee the station and return to Cardassia with him before the Federation troops retook the station, she was killed by Gul Dukat's first officer Damar after he overheard her confession to her father about having helped free the New Resistance members. Dukat underwent an immediate and near catatonic mental breakdown after witnessing his daughter's death right before his eyes. Weyoun[edit] Main article: Weyoun Winn Adami[edit]        Kai Winn Adami held the title of "Vedek" during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, and claimed to have been beaten for her religious teachings. She had a contemptuous attitude toward Bajorans who fought in the underground resistance cells, because she felt she did not get proper credit for helping to fight for Bajor's liberation. She was played by Louise Fletcher. Winn makes her first appearance objecting to the teachings of Keiko O'Brien in the Deep Space Nine school, in the episode "In the Hands of the Prophets." In particular, she objects to Keiko's teaching of only the scientific information about the Bajoran wormhole, instead of teaching the religious mythos regarding it. Winn views the science-based teachings as blasphemy, and eventually her influence results in all of the Bajoran students being pulled from the school. Later, a bomb is detonated inside the school. Commander Benjamin Sisko meets with Vedek Bareil on Bajor and asks him to reprimand Winn before she stirs up more violence, but he declines to enter into the conflict. Winn also directs one of her supporters to assassinate Bareil, who is Winn's chief rival in the Vedek Assembly. The failed assassination attempt is made during a speech Bareil is giving calling for an end to conflicts over the school. Winn's involvement, although suspected by Major Kira Nerys, is never proven. Ever the ambitious opportunist, Winn later aligned herself with an extremist group called "The Circle." The Circle's goal was to eliminate all external influences from Bajor, including the Federation, which would have served Winn's purposes in getting rid of Commander Sisko, whom she resented as the Emissary of the Prophets. The reward for her support would have been the guarantee of becoming Kai. Eventually it was discovered that "The Circle" was actually being supplied by the Cardassians. Major Kira managed to sneak into the council chambers and presented the evidence to the Council of Ministers. When Kira announced she has the thumb scan of a Cardassian Gul signing off on a shipment of weapons to the Kressari, who in turn sent them on to The Circle, Winn immediately changed sides telling Minister Jaro that if he truly believes the Cardassians were not supplying the weapons, he should not mind an examination of the evidence. In the episode "The Collaborator," the election for the next Kai approaches. Winn seeks out and obtains information about the Kendra Valley Massacre, which she uses to manipulate Major Kira into investigating Vedek Bareil Antos, who is in a relationship with Kira at the time. Ultimately, Bareil is forced to withdraw, resulting in Winn's election as Kai. Although Bareil is later proven innocent by Kira, he chooses not to reveal the truth, which is that Kai Opaka had actually been responsible for the massacre---a move that resulted in forty-three deaths, including that of her own son, but which had saved thousands of other Bajoran lives. Over the years, Bareil faithfully kept the secret to protect the Bajoran people and preserve their religion. When the first minister of the provisional government dies, Winn gets herself appointed to the political office, and tries to reclaim soil reclamation equipment developed by the Bajoran agricultural ministry and loaned to a group of farmers. She wants to have it used to reclaim soil for cash crops for sale off-planet, while a group of farmers led by Shakaar, a former resistance leader, are trying to reclaim soil to produce food for Bajor; Shakaar and his people had been promised the reclamators, but Winn, now leading the government, reneges on the previous leadership's promise. A brief insurrection, with Shakaar's people preparing to fight security forces sent out by Winn, results in the security force leader and Shakaar burying the hatchet. Shakaar challenges Winn for the position of first minister in the upcoming election. Throughout her service as both Vedek and Kai, Winn always proved to be selfish, arrogant, and power-hungry. She would do anything, and betray anyone to advance her own career and agenda. She is also jealous of other people receiving visions from the Prophets, especially the alien, Sisko the Emissary. In the final days of the Dominion War, Winn finally received what she believed to be a vision from the Prophets, who tell her that a guide will soon appear to her. In reality, this vision was from the Pah Wraiths, and the "guide" was Gul Dukat, who had been surgically altered to look like a Bajoran. Dukat and Winn soon became lovers, and he convinced her that to restore Bajor, she must release the Pah Wraiths, who he claimed were the true prophets of Bajor. To do this, Winn obtained the Kosst Amojan, a forbidden text, but found that the pages were blank. Her servant Solbor discovered what she and Dukat were planning. He revealed Dukat's true identity and threatened to expose them. As Winn killed him to prevent this revelation, a drop of blood fell from the knife Winn stabbed him with, and onto the blank pages of the Kosst Amojan, revealing the text. Later when Dukat attempted to read the Kosst Amojan himself, he was blinded (the text could only be read by the Kai), and cast out onto the streets by Winn. After studying the text, Winn discovered there is only one way to release the Pah Wraiths from the Fire Caves and hesitantly allowed Dukat to rejoin her. Back on Deep Space Nine in Vic Fontaine's holosuite programme, the Prophets send Sisko a premonition about a dangerous situation on Bajor. In the series finale "What You Leave Behind" and after the battle of Cardassia, Sisko traveled to the Fire Caves on Bajor to confront Winn and Dukat. While Dukat and Sisko fight, Winn realized she has made the wrong choices and that she had been blinded by her own ambitions. In an effort to correct all that she had done and redeem herself, she attempted to throw the book of the Pah Wraiths into the fire and destroy it. Before she could do so, Dukat disintegrated her using powers given to him by the Pah Wraiths. Yates, Kasidy[edit] Kasidy Danielle Yates, played by Penny Johnson Jerald, is a civilian freighter captain. She is introduced to Benjamin Sisko by his son Jake, who feels it is time for Sisko to start dating again after the death of his first wife Jennifer at Wolf 359. Jake's attempt at matchmaking is successful, and Kasidy and Sisko become lovers, even after her arrest and eventual imprisonment for aiding the Maquis. Following her release from prison, the two resume their relationship. Eventually, Kasidy becomes Sisko's second wife and, at the end of the series, she becomes pregnant with their child. When Sisko leaves to join the Prophets, he tells her that he will be away for a while, but would eventually return to her. Zek[edit] Zek was the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance throughout most of the 24th century. He was played by Wallace Shawn. Zek attempted retirement shortly after the discovery of the wormhole near Bajor. He arrived on DS9 and during a business meeting announced Quark would be his successor, and then appeared to have died. Eventually it was discovered that Zek faked his death by entering into a trance his attendant Maihar'Du taught him. The whole set-up was a test to see if his son Krax was ready to take over, but Krax failed miserably: by trying to seize power (assisted by Rom); by attempting to kill Quark instead of acquiring it quietly. The proper approach was to learn all the favorable deals and assume power by subterfuge and cunning, in keeping with 'Rule of Acquisition' number 168: "Whisper your way to success". Zek visited the Bajoran Prophets within the wormhole in an attempt to gather information about the future which he could use to increase his profits. Instead, the Prophets 'devolved' Zek's personality to that of a proto-Ferengi, before his people had dedicated their lives to the acquisition of wealth. During his time in this state, Zek made many radical reforms to his people's laws and government directing his people away from their greedy ways, including reformatting the long-standing Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. He was eventually changed back and his reforms nullified after Quark successfully appealed to the Prophets' fear of interaction with other corporeal life forms that might come to their domains to investigate the change. (DS9: "Prophet Motive") During a Tongo tournament on Ferenginar, Zek received a tip from Ishka, the mother of Quark and Rom, which helped him make a comeback to win the tournament. They eventually fell in love. They were briefly broken up by Quark at the prodding of Liquidator Brunt who was plotting to depose Zek and succeed him as Nagus. Ultimately the effort failed: Quark became aware of the plan, stopped Brunt's takeover, and got Zek and Ishka back together again. (DS9: "Ferengi Love Songs") Zek, suffering from failing memory, bequeathed all his financial dealings to the financially brilliant Ishka, eventually caving in to her not-so-subtle prods for female rights. He was once again deposed, this time by Brunt, after he amended the Ferengi constitution to allow females to wear clothes in public, but was later reinstated after the populace learned of the new and exciting business opportunities such reforms would pave. Under Ishka's influence, he further reformed the Ferengi political and economic system into a significantly less syndicalist model. Eventually, he and Ishka retired to Risa after naming Rom as his successor. See also[edit]  List of Star Trek characters  References[edit]   ^ Westmore, Michael.
