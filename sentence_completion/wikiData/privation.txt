   Look up privation in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.   Privation is the absence or lack of basic necessities.[1] The term can be used in a psychological context, often referring to a lack of relationships, or a philosophical context, where vital qualities are absent. Privation in psychology[edit] In psychology, privation occurs when a child has no opportunity to form a relationship with a parent figure, or when such relationship is distorted, due to their treatment.[2] It is different to deprivation, which occurs when an established relationship is severed.[3] It is understood that privation can produce social, emotional and intellectual problems for children; however, how inevitable such problems become as a result of privation, and the extent to which they can be reversed, remains an issue of debate among psychologists.[4] Privation in philosophy[edit] In philosophy, privation may refer to the absence of a necessary quality in the universe.[citation needed] For example, as part of his theodicy, Augustine denied the existence of evil as its own entity; rather, he described evil as a privation, or going wrong, of good, privatio boni.[5] Jewish philosopher Maimonides argued that privation is not necessarily a bad thing: it would be trivial to regard the privation of hair – baldness – as an evil.
