Three independent python source files

I am using python package 'tabulate' to pretty print the results.
Please do 'pip install tabulate' before running the following code.

1.pos_fine.py --> Contains source for part 1
2.pos_coarse_1.py --> Contains source for part 2 method A
3.pos_coarse_2.py --> Contains source for part 2 method B

Experimental results:

Three prediction files

1. part-1-predictions.tsv
2. Method-A-predictions.tsv
3. Method-B-predictions.tsv
